This data consists of orthorectified image derivatives from the Level Basic-1B bundled imagery provided to the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources (OMNR) by Digital Globe, Inc. </p> <p>Pansharpened images (60 - 70 cm true colour composites) are required for mapping applications that require high-resolution background imagery. Additional image derivatives, such as enhanced Multispectral and Greyscale (Panchromatic) products (GeoTIFF and MrSID formats) may also be generated depending on requirements. Raw (Basic-1B) imagery was secured from Digital Globe to ensure that the orthorectification process could be conducted under the supervision of OMNR staff, with an adherence to the geospatial standards of the Natural Resources Values Information System (NRVIS).</p>","<p>Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources. <em>QuickBird Satellite Imagery - Source Water Protection: Panchromatic imagery, greyscale</em> [digital resource: grid].

27646,Digital Raster Acquisition Project Eastern Ontario (DRAPE) 2019,2020 - 2021,Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources,Various geospatial formats available.,,"<p><a href=""http://geo.scholarsportal.info/#r/details/_uri@=2799205642"">Access this resource</a> on Scholars Geoportal.</p>","<p>Digital Raster Acquisition Project Eastern Ontario (DRAPE) was acquired in the spring of 2019/2020 under the best conditions possible to achieve cloud free, snow free, ice free, smoke free, and leaf off captures. The orthophotography covers 36,103 sq km, has a pixel resolution of 16cm and is accurate to 45 centimetres on the ground at 95%. The imagery was acquired by an Vexcel UltraCam X and Vexcel UltraCamEagle digital cameras and was later orthorectified using an elevation dataset generated through image correlation.</p><p><b>Compressed GeoTIFFs:</b> These images are JPEG-compressed GeoTIFFs, and are suitable for analysis in many cases. Should you require uncompressed TIFF files, these may be requested for download by contacting geoportal@scholarsportal.info, and providing your name and institution (ex. University of Guelph).</p><p> <b>Please note:</b> Due to the size of these tiles (~500 MB each), please request a portion of the data only. This can be done by including a polygon file of the study area, a description of a desired feature/area (ex. UTM campus), or a screenshot in your e-mail. </p>","<p>Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources. <em>Digital Raster Acquisition Project Eastern Ontario (DRAPE) 2019</em> [digital resource: grid].
