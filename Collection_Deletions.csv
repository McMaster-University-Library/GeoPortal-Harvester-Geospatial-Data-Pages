As part of the LHIN's mandate, there is often a need to analyse and present information at finer scales. As a result, all LHINs have defined smaller geographic areas within their boundaries. Although the naming convention varies between LHINs, in this product these regions are referred to as ""SubLHIN planning areas"" or, more compactly, as ""subLHINs"".</p> <p>The external boundaries of the province's LHINs are embedded in legislation and have remained stable since 2006. In contrast, subLHINs are defined by the individual LHINs for their own analytical and planning purposes. SubLHIN geographic definitions vary substantially between LHINs and are subject to change because of the needs of indivdual LHINs.</p> <p>In 2007, subLHIN boundaries were assembled for the province by the Health System Intelligence Project (HSIP) from definitions provided by the LHINs. In April, 2008, with the cessation of HSIP, the Health Analytics Branch (HAB) of the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care took over the maintenance of the provincial subLHIN boundary file. Updates to the subLHIN boundaries were passive and new versions of the boundary file were created only when a LHIN approached HAB with new geographic definitions. Beginning with Version 9.0 of the subLHIN boundaries, the MOHLTC consulted all LHINs to design and establish each LHINs planning areas.</p> <p>Version 9.0 reflects substantial change in the subLHIN boundaries compared to version 8.0. The most fundamental change is that three LHINs (Champlain, Hamilton Niagara Haldimand Brant (HNHB) and Central East) have requested two subLHIN levels. In this documentation and in all other material relating to subLHINs (including boundary files and crosswalks) these levels are referred to as Primary and Secondary.</p> <p>Primary subLHINs are the 'highest' level of subLHIN geography and encompass larger areas, while secondary subLHINs are more detailed and, in all three LHINs where secondary subLHINs have been defined, nest inside of the larger primary subLHINs.</p> <p>Where possible the secondary subLHINs should used as the default subLHINs, with the primary reserved for conditions where data are unavailable or not stable using the secondary definitions.</p>",,,http://geo.scholarsportal.info/#r/details/_uri@=1560932699,Internet,Health,Ontario,Vector,https://library.mcmaster.ca/sites/default/files/geospatial/ogde_moh_slhnb.png,,,1560932699,,,,,

To achieve this, it was critical to consider the challenges that persons with disabilities could have when interacting with and interpreting maps.

The document focuses on the following considerations for accessible map design:
•	Contrast 
•	Colour
•	Style and Patterns
•	Font Selection
•	Annotation and Labelling
•	Simplicity and Consistency
•	Alternative Formats and Descriptions

The document was endorsed in 2016 by the GIS in the OPS Director Manager Working Group (DMWG).

Although there are new and emerging technologies for creating maps for users with disabilities, the majority of this document is intended to assist designers creating map content for a range of users who have full sight to those with moderately low vision who do not use assistive technology.

The document does not address the technology or medium used to generate or publish the final map product, or the accessibility concerns that arise out of any technology, such as those outlined in Web Content Accessibility Guidelines published by the World Wide Web Consortium for content published on the web.  

The concepts described within the document are applicable to map design, regardless of how a map is created, produced, or delivered. Consult with your Ministry's Accessibility Coordinator for assistance in these and other areas of accessibility considerations.",,,http://geo.scholarsportal.info/#r/details/_uri@=89bf27af-941a-4183-9a63-6dd25de71988,Internet,Human Environment,,,,,,89bf27af-941a-4183-9a63-6dd25de71988,,,,,
