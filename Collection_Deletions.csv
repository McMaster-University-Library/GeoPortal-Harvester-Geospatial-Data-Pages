</ul>","<p>The inventory for recreational land use capability has 7 Classes, from Class 1 with high capability to Class 7 with very low capability. The classification also examines the quantity of recreational use that a land unit can attract and withstand without permanent damage to the natural landscape.</p>
<p>Intensive and dispersed activities are recognized in the classification. Intensive activities are those in which relatively large numbers of people may be accommodated per unit area, such as a beach. Dispersed activities are those which normally require a relatively larger area per person such as backcountry camping.</p>
<p>The inventory is based on interpretation of aerial photographs, field checks, and available records. Capability maps are displayed with a 1:50,000 scale.</p>

","<p>Only a small selection of the country was produced. The coverage is divided by the NTS 1:50 000 index.</p>
<p>The mapping of land use capability is prepared from an analysis of the individual sector capability maps, supplemented by information on present land use and socio-economic conditions. By identifying the areas under classes, it is possible to determine the distribution and acreage of the best areas for each land resource activity. This also reveals the areas where land-use conflicts may arise.</p>
<p>Additional study is carried out in those areas having potential for more than one use. With good management, secondary uses will also be possible. Numerous instances of transitional use occur and present the greatest problems in interpretation.</p>
<p>This is particularly important because demands made on our land resources, and environmental problems and changing technology have forced land-based industries to make major changes in their land utilization practices. Fourteen classes of land use represent the land use capability map at a scale of 1:250,000.</p>

","<p>The CLI is a comprehensive survey of land capability and use designed to provide a basis for resource and land use planning. It includes assessments of land capability for agriculture, forestry, recreation, wildlife, and land use planning projects in each province.</p>
<p>It was undertaken as a cooperative federal-provincial program.</p>
<p>The CLI covers the settled portions of rural Canada and adjoining areas which affect the income and employment opportunities of rural residents. Thus it covers the area of Canada where questions of alternative use of land have a strong bearing on sustainable rural development</p>
<p>Lands are classified according to: their physical capability for use in agriculture, forestry, recreation, and wildlife; and their present use.</p>
<p>This collection contains about 15 1:1 million maps, showing for each sector province/region wide capability. The 1:1 million maps are a summary of the data available on the larger scale maps, at 1:250,000 and 1:50 000.</p>

",Esri Interchange file (.e00),Public,"<p>The dataset is available through the <a href=""http://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset?q=Sport+Fish+Capability"">Open Government Portal</a></p>
","<p>Sport Fish Capability is an un-published series of the Canada Land Inventory. The inventory may be incomplete and is currently only available in this digital form for the province of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and for parts of the province of Alberta. Some of the maps for Alberta may have been published as part of the Alberta Land Inventory; the Alberta land Inventory also published similar maps for other areas of the province which are not part of this digital inventory.</p>
<p>The CLI Sport Fish classification rates watersheds and selected lakes and rivers for their suitability for sport fish production. The capability ratings are established on the basis of physical, chemical and certain biological parameters but do not necessarily reflect actual sport fish production.</p>
<p>In the CLI sport fish classification system, the water bodies are divided into units on the basis of physical, chemical and biological characteristics important to fish populations. The degree of limitation associated with each unit determines its capability class. The subclass denotes the primary factor that causes the limitation.</p>
<p>Unlike other CLI capability ratings, only waters with high fish production potential are classified and the domain of the capability classification is restricted to four classes as follows:</p>
<p>Class 1 - Waters in this class have no significant limitations on sport fish production.</p>
<p>Class 2 - Waters in this class have few or minor limitations on sport fish production.</p>
<p>Class 3 - Waters in this class have several minor limitations or few serious limitations on sport fish production.</p>
<p>Class 4 - Waters have numerous and severe limitations on sport fish production.</p>
<p>The limitation subclass takes on different meaning depending on the type of unit being classified. Streams may be limited by nutrients, bank cover, substrate, discharge, frequency and depth of pools, land use, refuge and/or water temperature. Lakes may be limited by depth, wind exposure, light penetration, nutrients, oxygen, spawning and/or water temperature.</p>
<p>For distribution purposes the original classification data has been integrated with the corresponding CLI shoreline and the results have been projected to UTM. There is no latitude/longitude equivalent of these data in the distribution files.</p>

","<p>Maps showing land capability to support ungulate species of wildlife (deer, moose, etc.).</p>
<p>The mapping of land capability for ungulates follows a national system developed with the aid of the Canadian Wildlife Service and the game branches of the provinces. The ungulate sector uses seven classes, like the others. In addition to class and subclass, the system indicates the ungulate species to which the classification refers. Capability for ungulate production implies a sufficient quantity and quality of food, protective cover, and space to meet the needs for survival, growth, and reproduction.</p>
<p>Capability mapping is accomplished through interpretation of air photographs and by field surveys. Capability ratings are also established on the basis of the optimum vegetational stage that can be maintained with good wildlife management practices.</p>

","<p>The mapping of land capability for waterfowl wildlife is based on a national classification system comparable with the other Canada Land Inventory sectors. Capability for waterfowl production requires a feeding habitat, protective cover, and space to meet the needs for growth and reproduction.</p>
<p>A class number is assigned to each land unit based on known or inferred information on parent material, soil profile, depth, moisture, fertility, landform, climatic factors, and vegetation. Colour coding the classes provides convenient means of separating the various class units.</p>
<p>The capability mapping has a scale of 1:250,000 and is accomplished through interpretation of air photography and by field surveys. Location of the land, access, ownership, distance from cities or roads, and present condition of the land unit are not considered in assigning a capability class. Excessive or insufficient hunting pressures do not limit the capability of the land and are not used in assigning classification values.</p>
