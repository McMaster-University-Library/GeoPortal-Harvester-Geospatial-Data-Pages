A watershed, also known as a catchment basin or area, includes all of the land that is drained by a watercourse and its tributaries. These divisions are based on the federal 'Drainage Area' reporting framework originally known as the Water Resources Index Inventory Filing System (WRIIF).</p> <p>'The Water Survey of Canada (or, as it was known then, the Department of the Interior, Dominion Water Power Branch) first developed, in 1922, a Water Resources Index Inventory as a convenient and logical system for recording and filing water resources data. It was designed for the storage of such information as the location of waterpower sites, waterpower developments, storage reservoirs, stream measurement stations, and meteorological stations. The Water Survey of Canada delineations involved the division, sub-division and sub-sub-division of Canada into suitably sized areas based on the drainage, for administrative purposes. Although the boundaries are based on drainage, the intent was to include all of Canada's land mass and waters within this drainage area hierarchy to facilitate the identification of hydrometeorological sites. Therefore, the WSC drainage areas do not necessarily define individual river basins, but can represent intervening areas along the coast or include islands.' (National Scale Frameworks HYDROLOGY Version 5.0, NRCan, 2003)</p><p>ABOUT THIS RELEASE: These boundaries have been created based on the recent Version 2 Provincial DEM and Enhanced Flow Direction products released 2006-2008. The generation of the boundaries also involved some enhanced interpolation and smoothing techniques to produce a final product that is consistent with the current regional hydrology available for Ontario. Watershed naming conventions have also been revised to be more closely in line with Federal names where appropriate.</p>",,,"<p><a href=""http://geo.scholarsportal.info/#r/details/_uri@=834889117"">Access this resource</a> on Scholars Geoportal.</p>",Internet,Water Resources,Ontario,vector,http://images.scholarsportal.info/gis/thumbnails/OGDE/OGDE_WTRSHTER.png,,,834889117,,,,,,,

Dikes are therefore long linear bodies of igneous rock that can extend laterally for hundreds of kilometers with a width of perhaps a few hundred meters. Dikes normally occur, not as single dikes, but rather as several parallel dikes forming a dike swarm all of the same material which intruded at roughly the same time. The most common dike swarms in the Precambrian of Ontario are diabase dike swarms extending up to 3000 km in length which can form up to 30% of the Earth's crust at the center of the swarm.</p><p>This data set is part of the Bedrock Geology Data Set, which is a Geological map of the Province and shows the distribution of bedrock units underlying Ontario. It illustrates geological rock types, major faults, iron formations, kimberlite intrusions, and dike swarms. The geology of the Province consists of Precambrian rocks of the Canadian Shield and Phanerozoic sedimentary rocks in basins that overlie the Canadian Shield. Based on differences in age, metamorphism and tectonic setting, the Precambrian rocks are subdivided into the Superior, Southern and Grenville provinces. The Phanerozoic rocks occur in four basins. Major faults and shear zones are also included. The legend is subdivided geochronologically in the Phanerozoic, but geochronometrically in the Proterozoic and Archean. The Archean rocks of the Superior Province are subdivided into lithologic units. Supracrustal units of the Southern Province and the Phanerozoic Eon are subdivided lithostratigraphically. The Grenville Province is subdivided into major tectonic blocks and within each block the legend is mainly lithologic, with only part of the supracrustal rock record subdivided into lithostratigraphic units.

Most secondary divisions are either large river systems or groupings of small coastal streams. A watershed, also known as a catchment basin or area, includes all of the land that is drained by a watercourse and its tributaries. These divisions are based on the federal 'Drainage Area' reporting framework originally known as the Water Resources Index Inventory Filing System (WRIIF).</p><p>'The Water Survey of Canada (or, as it was known then, the Department of the Interior, Dominion Water Power Branch) first developed, in 1922, a Water Resources Index Inventory as a convenient and logical system for recording and filing water resources data. It was designed for the storage of such information as the location of waterpower sites, waterpower developments, storage reservoirs, stream measurement stations, and meteorological stations. The Water Survey of Canada delineations involved the division, sub-division and sub-sub-division of Canada into suitably sized areas based on the drainage, for administrative purposes. Although the boundaries are based on drainage, the intent was to include all of Canada's land mass and waters within this drainage area hierarchy to facilitate the identification of hydrometeorological sites. Therefore, the WSC drainage areas do not necessarily define individual river basins, but can represent intervening areas along the coast or include islands.' (National Scale Frameworks HYDROLOGY Version 5.0, NRCan, 2003)</p><p>ABOUT THIS RELEASE: These boundaries have been created based on the recent Version 2 Provincial DEM and Enhanced Flow Direction products released 2006-2008. The generation of the boundaries also involved some enhanced interpolation and smoothing techniques to produce a final product that is consistent with the current regional hydrology available for Ontario. Watershed naming conventions have also been revised to be more closely in line with Federal names where appropriate.</p>",,,"<p><a href=""http://geo.scholarsportal.info/#r/details/_uri@=1589523613"">Access this resource</a> on Scholars Geoportal.</p>",Internet,Water Resources,Ontario,vector,http://images.scholarsportal.info/gis/thumbnails/OGDE/OGDE_WTRSHSEC.png,,,1589523613,,,,,,,

The Water Survey of Canada delineations involved the division, sub-division and sub-sub-division of Canada into suitably sized areas based on the drainage, for administrative purposes. Although the boundaries are based on drainage, the intent was to include all of Canada's land mass and waters within this drainage area hierarchy to facilitate the identification of hydrometeorological sites.

These surficial deposits overly a bedrock terrain consisting mainly of Phanerozoic sedimentary rocks that overlie older Precambrian rocks of the Canadian Shield. </p><p>The data used in generating the map was derived from Quaternary maps, primarily at a scale of 1:50 000, completed by the OGS and Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) for most of southern Ontario over the past 40 years.</p><p>The Surficial Geology of Southern Ontario - Miscellaneous feature is part of the Surficial Geology of Southern Ontario series.
