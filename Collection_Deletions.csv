48793,Lidar Classified Point Cloud (2016-17),2017 - 2007,"Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs",Various geospatial formats available.,Public,"<p><a href=""http://geo.scholarsportal.info/#r/details/_uri@=""19c7687a-5df3-4253-97ab-0dfbedd85ec4"">Access this resource</a> on Scholars Geoportal.</p>","The Lidar Classified Point Cloud (2016-17) consists of points containing elevation and intensity information derived from returns collected by an airborne lidar sensor.
The lidar point cloud covers selected regional areas in Southern Ontario and portions of Northern Ontario.  This data is the output of the first year of a two year data collection project.  Data collection occurred during the fall of 2016 and spring of 2017.  Data will be updated to include, Lake Erie and remaining Peterborough and Cochrane project areas in the first half of 2018. 
A classification scheme has been applied to the point cloud by the contractor to identify the type of target from which the return is reflected, and differentiates between bare-earth terrain points, water, high and low noise returns.  The classified point cloud is organized into non-overlapping 1km x 1km tiles.
