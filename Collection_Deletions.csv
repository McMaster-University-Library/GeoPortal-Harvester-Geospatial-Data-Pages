Includes: 
Contour Land
Contour Land Approximate
Contour Land Auxiliary/Interpolated 
Contour Land Depression

In southern Ontario the contour interval is 5 meters.
In the near north the contour interval is 10 meters.
In the far north the contour interval varies dependant on the source of the information
Legislated or Legal Authority for Collection: None
Additional Time Period Information: Data is collected on an irregular basis therefore the time period 'end date' may be more recent than indicated above.
As individual errors are identified, they will be corrected. Larger updates to the contour layer will not occur until a better elevation source is available.
Contour data is available for download from the links provided below.

To achieve this, it was critical to consider the challenges that persons with disabilities could have when interacting with and interpreting maps.

The document focuses on the following considerations for accessible map design:
•	Contrast 
•	Colour
•	Style and Patterns
•	Font Selection
•	Annotation and Labelling
•	Simplicity and Consistency
•	Alternative Formats and Descriptions

The document was endorsed in 2016 by the GIS in the OPS Director Manager Working Group (DMWG).

Although there are new and emerging technologies for creating maps for users with disabilities, the majority of this document is intended to assist designers creating map content for a range of users who have full sight to those with moderately low vision who do not use assistive technology.

The document does not address the technology or medium used to generate or publish the final map product, or the accessibility concerns that arise out of any technology, such as those outlined in Web Content Accessibility Guidelines published by the World Wide Web Consortium for content published on the web.  

The concepts described within the document are applicable to map design, regardless of how a map is created, produced, or delivered. Consult with your Ministry's Accessibility Coordinator for assistance in these and other areas of accessibility considerations.",,,http://geo.scholarsportal.info/#r/details/_uri@=89bf27af-941a-4183-9a63-6dd25de71988,Internet,Human Environment,,,,,,89bf27af-941a-4183-9a63-6dd25de71988,,,,,
