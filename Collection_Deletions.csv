Only about one percent of Ontario’s lakes contain Lake Trout, but this represents 20-25% of all Lake Trout lakes in the world. The province, therefore, as a great responsibility to manage them wisely. OMNRF efforts to develop a coordinated strategy to protect Lake Trout populations in Ontario requires a comprehensive list of lakes currently designated for Lake Trout management. 
 
This report lists the inland Ontario lakes (exclusive of the Great Lakes) that are currently designated for Lake Trout management. In addition, the list classifies the lakes as to whether they are to be managed for naturally reproducing populations (‘Natural’ lakes) or as put-grow-take (‘P-G-T’) lakes. ‘Natural’ lakes include those lakes that may have lost populations but have been identified for rehabilitation. ‘P-G-T’ lakes are managed to provide recreational fishing opportunities and/or to direct angling effort away from more sensitive ‘Natural’ lakes. OMNRF policies or guidelines may be applied differently depending on the lake classification, or in other cases may be applied to both classifications in a similar manner. 
 
Individual Lake Trout lakes are listed alphabetically in tables organized by OMNRF Administrative Regions. 
 
Most lakes managed for Lake Trout will have been identified previously in other resource management plans. This list supersedes previously published lists and will be subject to revision from time to time, as updated scientific assessment and inventory data become available. Subsequent revisions will be posted on the EBR Registry for public notice and comment. More detailed information on individual lakes may be available from local OMNRF offices.",,,"<p><a href=""http://geo.scholarsportal.info/#r/details/_uri@=8d020341-f942-4804-b200-bf2d07db2942"">Access this resource</a> on Scholars Geoportal.</p>",Internet,Human Environment,,,,,,8d020341-f942-4804-b200-bf2d07db2942,,,,,

In 2009, the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF), along with other Canadian Provincial counterparts were invited to participate in a Natural Resources Canada (NRCAN) initiative to define the National Railway Network (NRWN) to be stored and maintained in GeoGratis. The project’s goal was to define a national standard for railway network spatial and attribute information.
The NRWN project involved extensive consultation with information owners of railway geospatial datasets from both Private and Public sectors. At the same time, the MNRF’s Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) program re-examined the business needs for their own LIO railway-themed information. As crucial internal business requirements were reflected in the proposed NRWN data standards, SDI launched a project to adapt these into LIO Warehouse Database versions of the NRWN geospatial layers.
As a result of this exercise, seven Ontario Railway Network (ORWN) LIO data classes were implemented to reflect active railway information:
1. ORWN Track (line segment)
2. ORWN Structure Line (line segment)
3. ORWN Structure Point (point feature)
4. ORWN Crossing (point feature)
5. ORWN Station (point feature)

In 1968 the Department of Lands and Forests initiated the Aquatic Habitat Inventory Program to collect information for Ontario’s inland water data.  One product was a series of contour maps showing lake depth. In many cases, these maps still represent the only authoritative source of bathymetry data for lakes in Ontario. These maps have been converted to digital GIS data which has resulted in the vast majority of the current data in the Bathymetry Line data class. 
More recent bathymetric data has been collected using sonar and GPS technology. This modern technique creates lake depth points (spot depths) rather than contours. This point data is stored in the Bathymetry Point data class.
 
Bathymetry Points indicate the measurement of water depth at various places in a body of water, and are often called spot depths.
The data in this layer has primarily been collected using a depth measurement device, such as an echo-sounder, in combination with a GPS for horizontal positioning. However, other survey methods such as bathymetric LiDAR may also have been used. Please see the Bathymetry Index layer for the survey method used in each water body.
The points in this layer are the source data for all bathymetric data and should be used (when available) for the creation of bathymetric derivative products such as rasters, TINs and depth contours. Point densities will vary by water body and within water bodies, depending on the parameters or the survey.
Bathymetry point and line data should not be used for navigational purposes.

In 1968 the Department of Lands and Forests initiated the Aquatic Habitat Inventory Program to collect information for Ontario’s inland water data.  One product was a series of contour maps showing lake depth. In many cases, these maps still represent the only authoritative source of bathymetry data for lakes in Ontario. These maps have been converted to digital GIS data which has resulted in the vast majority of the current data in the Bathymetry Line data class. 
More recent bathymetric data has been collected using sonar and GPS technology. This modern technique creates lake depth points (spot depths) rather than contours. This point data is stored in the Bathymetry Point data class.

Bathymetry Line contains lines of constant depth called depth contours or isobars.  Depth contours are used to describe the terrain relief below the surface of the water.
The data used to derive the depth contours are always spot depths but the density and positional accuracy of these spot depths vary depending on the survey style and parameters. Before GPS data was available, spot depth locations were derived by straight line transects across a water body which were then plotted on a map. The time consuming nature of this method limited the number of transects collected. Now GPS data collection is not limited to transects and therefore spot depth collections tend to be far denser with greater horizontal accuracy.
Depth contours have been derived in one of two ways: 
1. Visually interpreted and drawn by hand based on transects of the water body
2. Interpolated using GIS processes such as Kriging or Natural Neighbours
Vertical accuracy of the data varies greatly depending on the density of spot depth collected for each lake. Horizontal accuracy will also vary greatly on older transect based collections but will be within 5m for GPS based collections.
Bathymetry point and line data should not be used for navigational purposes.

Land Classification as used by the Ontario Land Inventory (OLI) is a system of describing the physical features of the land which exert the most significant influence upon the growth of the plant community.
The Timber Use Capability ratings of the OLI indicate the potential ability of land to grow tree crops.  These ratings are specifically related to the physical features which control the rate of tree growth.
Wildlife Use Capability indicates the natural ability of the land to provide the required habitat for a given species.  The selection of wildlife species for which an area is rated, is based on the natural range of each species.
Recreation Use Capability classifies the land for its inherent ability to attract and sustain recreation use.  The physical features of the land determine the intensity of use that can be attracted and sustained.  A recreation feature that can attract and sustain use by many people rates higher than a feature that can only attract and sustain a few.
The Shoreland Recreation information describes the physical features of the wet beach and backshore of a lake and rates the sites for their capability for bathing and camping activities and lodging and deep water activities.

ABOUT THIS RELEASE:

The Far North quaternary boundaries have been created based on ‘Version 2.0’ of the Ontario Integrated Hydrology Data (OIHD) product which will be released in spring, 2015. These boundaries are the first of their kind in the Far North of Ontario.   Previously this area only contained coarse tertiary watershed boundaries created using less accurate federal data. These new watersheds will help support Community Based Land Use Planning (CBLUP) activities in the Far North, and help First Nations communities understand where water is flowing across the landscape in order to better protect natural features of cultural, historical and environmental significance. 

The creation of these boundaries followed newly established watershed principles adopted by International, Federal and Provincial partners involved in globally integrated water resources management. Partnering agencies include the following:
 
•	International Joint Commission (IJC) 
•	Water Survey of Canada (WSC) / Natural Resources Canada (NRCan)
•	Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF)
•	United States Geological Survey (USGS)
•	Other provincial and state-side authorities depending on region of focus. 

This data is considered “Interim” in nature and will eventually be incorporated into a new ‘Version 3’ official update of Ontario’s Provincial Watershed layers. There are several other enhancements planned for these structured datasets, and therefore, a release date has not yet been determined. However, the Far North quaternary packaged product has been produced for the interim to specifically address immediate Far North planning needs at the regional landscape level. The watersheds included in this package cover the entire area draining to the Hudson-James Bay basin within Ontario (excluding the Rainy River basin).

The watershed creation process involved enhanced delineation and smoothing techniques to produce a final product that is consistent with the current regional hydrology available for Ontario. Watershed naming conventions have also been revised to be more closely in line with international naming standards established through the International Watersheds Initiative (IWI) led by IJC. 

A watershed, also known as a catchment basin or area, includes all the land that is drained by a watercourse and its tributaries. A quaternary watershed is a polygon feature that identifies one of the 1000+ subdivisions of the tertiary watershed divisions for all of Ontario. Watersheds created beyond the tertiary level will comply where possible with the USGS area-size criteria. Quaternary watersheds are comparable to the USGS (Hydrologic Unit Coding system) HUC-10 level watershed units in the United States, which have the recommended size range of 40000-250000 acres. A few exceptions apply where the landscape cannot be further subdivided or amalgamated into units which would fit within this acceptable range.

These quaternary divisions were historically developed by the province (dating back to the 1970’s) before the involvement of IJC.  Quaternary divisions were considered an extension of the federal 'Drainage Area' reporting framework originally known as the Water Resources Index Inventory Filing System (WRIIF), which only incorporated tertiary watersheds as the finest level nationally.

The Water Survey of Canada (or, as it was known then, the Department of the Interior, Dominion Water Power Branch) first developed, in 1922, a Water Resources Index Inventory as a convenient and logical system for recording and filing water resources data. It was designed for the storage of such information as the location of waterpower sites, waterpower developments, storage reservoirs, stream measurement stations, and meteorological stations. The Water Survey of Canada delineations involved the division, sub-division and sub-sub-division of Canada into suitably sized areas based on the drainage, for administrative purposes. Although the boundaries are based on drainage, the intent was to include all of Canada's land mass and waters within this drainage area hierarchy to facilitate the identification of hydrometeorological sites. Therefore, the WSC drainage areas do not necessarily define individual river basins, but can represent intervening areas along the coast or include islands.' (National Scale Frameworks HYDROLOGY Version 5.0, NRCan, 2003)

The horizontal positional accuracy of the boundaries is variable depending on the nature and spatial distribution of the raw DEM information, and thus cannot be validated without onsite investigation and verification. In general, southern Ontario is typically within 100m, north-central Ontario ('near north') is within 400m in the Ontario Base Map (OBM) Forestry Area of Undertaking, and the Far North is generally considered within 900m (currently, there is no statistical level of confidence available).
The Far North was derived from 1:50K federal CanVec data, SPOT and Landsat Imagery, and 2000 Shuttle Radar DSM information.",,,"<p><a href=""http://geo.scholarsportal.info/#r/details/_uri@=5a8b07f0-445a-48d1-aa42-a4b1b0b910b4"">Access this resource</a> on Scholars Geoportal.</p>",Internet,Water Resources,,,,,,5a8b07f0-445a-48d1-aa42-a4b1b0b910b4,,,,,

In 2009, the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF), along with other Canadian Provincial counterparts were invited to participate in a Natural Resources Canada (NRCAN) initiative to define the National Railway Network (NRWN) to be stored and maintained in GeoGratis. The project’s goal was to define a national standard for railway network spatial and attribute information.
The NRWN project involved extensive consultation with information owners of railway geospatial datasets from both Private and Public sectors. At the same time, the MNRF’s Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) program re-examined the business needs for their own LIO railway-themed information. As crucial internal business requirements were reflected in the proposed NRWN data standards, SDI launched a project to adapt these into LIO Warehouse Database versions of the NRWN geospatial layers.
As a result of this exercise, seven Ontario Railway Network (ORWN) LIO data classes were implemented to reflect active railway information:
1. ORWN Track (line segment)
2. ORWN Structure Line (line segment)
3. ORWN Structure Point (point feature)
4. ORWN Crossing (point feature)
5. ORWN Station (point feature)
6. ORWN Marker Post (point feature)

In general, one linear feature represents the two rails of a track. A track is bounded by two junction points and is segmented at each change in attributes along its course.

In 2009, the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF), along with other Canadian Provincial counterparts were invited to participate in a Natural Resources Canada (NRCAN) initiative to define the National Railway Network (NRWN) to be stored and maintained in GeoGratis. The project’s goal was to define a national standard for railway network spatial and attribute information.
The NRWN project involved extensive consultation with information owners of railway geospatial datasets from both Private and Public sectors. At the same time, the MNRF’s Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) program re-examined the business needs for their own LIO railway-themed information. As crucial internal business requirements were reflected in the proposed NRWN data standards, SDI launched a project to adapt these into LIO Warehouse Database versions of the NRWN geospatial layers.
As a result of this exercise, seven Ontario Railway Network (ORWN) LIO data classes were implemented to reflect active railway information:
1. ORWN Track (line segment)
2. ORWN Structure Line (line segment)
3. ORWN Structure Point (point feature)
4. ORWN Crossing (point feature)
5. ORWN Station (point feature)
6. ORWN Marker Post (point feature)
7. ORWN Junction (point feature)
It should be noted that NRWN is not comprehensive and it is expected that as NRWN geospatial layers are revised by NRCAN, the ORWN will be updated shortly thereafter.",,,"<p><a href=""http://geo.scholarsportal.info/#r/details/_uri@=9be36af5-4db6-4bcb-9917-c4256f586bf5"">Access this resource</a> on Scholars Geoportal.</p>",Internet,Transportation,,,,,,9be36af5-4db6-4bcb-9917-c4256f586bf5,,,,,

ALIS delineates streams based on a number of different natural features. This application has been applied on the Ontario side of the Great Lakes to identify continuous valley segments and has been used to attribute landscape attributes for sites where fish and habitat data are available. The ALIS database is made up of two components: an application and a data component. The GIS application will offer users a tool to extract data, summarize and report results and classify, categorize, etc. the data collected through ALIS. The second component is strictly a Microsoft Access 2002 database containing the data. The GIS application component links to the data component, this allows for central control over the master attribute data. In order to run ALIS, the user must be running a licensed version of ArcGIS 8.1. or later. In addition, the user will also need a copy of Microsoft Access 2002 to store the data. Once the data has been collected, users with a copy of Microsoft Access 2000 will be able to work with the attribute data stored in the ALIS database independent of the GIS application. 
ALIS has also been incorporated into the Aquatic Ecosystem Classification: Great Lakes Basin - Coast, Streams, Lakes and Wetlands Data Class and the Great Lakes Conservation Blueprint for Aquatic Biodiversity. See associated documentation for these products for additional information on how ALIS may be implemented. Also of interest to some users is the Ontario Hydro Network (OHN) - Watercourse dataset.

Beaches were digitized by Austin Troy from Google Earth (no topology with SOLRIS) in order to support the development of ecological services estimates for the report Estimating Ecosystem Services in Southern Ontario by Spatial Informatics Group, Austin Troy & Ken Bagstad (2009). Two classes of beaches are distinguished, those with infrastructure and those without.

62. Beach near structure (not present in SOLRIS):
 Class description: Open sandy beach along the shore of a great lake, within
approximately 200 meters of a structure.

 Methods: 
1) selected ecodistricts for the case study. 
2)Created a 1 km buffer of those ecodistricts to account for the fact that many of the mapped beaches would be located outside the boundaries of those ecodistricts, which are designed to be at or near the shoreline. 
3) Clipped the region-wide land classification map described in this document to those buffered regions. Hence, some area designated as great lake nearshore was included in the clipped output.
 4)Ecodistricts were exported to Google Earth for overlay.
 5) All beaches were then digitized in Google Earth. Beaches near structures were stored with a different file name prefix than those that were not near structure (the vast majority of beaches fell in the near-structure categoryonly those in designated parks did not). The resulting KML files were imported to ArcGIS as a single geodatabase file.
 6 )A new code was created for each polygon designating whether the polygon was near or not-near a structure.
 7)The resulting polygon layer was then unioned (where all geometry is combined) with the
buffered ecodistricts layer.
 8) The resulting unioned layer was converted to raster, using the beach code as the gridcode. Because of the narrowness of many beaches, the output raster cell size was designated as 7.5 meters, or half the dimensional distance of a SOLRIS pixel.
 9)The clipped classification map (step 3, above), was then updated using the Conditional function in order to recode all pixels that overlaid a beach.

63. Beach (not present in SOLRIS):

meters of a structure.

These map tiles were based on the UTM Nad27 (May 76) coordinate system but have been transformed to NAD83 for storage. 

The tiles come in two sizes: 
• 10000m by 10000m for 1:20,000 and 
• 5000m by 5000m for 1:10,000

These map tiles are oriented according to UTM coordinates and the map identifier references the lower left corner. 
The mapsheet identifier is a 13 digit number in the following format: SSZZEEEENNNNN 
• SS represents scale (10 = 1:10,000 and 20 = 1:20,000) 
• ZZ represents the UTM zone number (15, 16, 17, 18) 
• EEEE are the first 4 digits of the UTM easting 
• NNNNN are the first 5 digits of the UTM northing

Maps on the UTM zone boundary will be trimmed by the UTM zone boundary. 


NOTE: Because of the transformation from NAD27 to NAD83 coordinate systems, the location of the index tiles will appear to be shifted.
The following two layers are Nad83 and can be used in place of the OBM_Index for current cartographic applications:

It identifies the location and type of crossing that traverses either on, above or below a track. A crossing includes any structure supporting that part of the track or facilitating the crossing. Crossings are often equipped with public warning signs and audio/visual signalling safeguards to control and protect vehicular and pedestrian traffic.

In 2009, the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF), along with other Canadian Provincial counterparts were invited to participate in a Natural Resources Canada (NRCAN) initiative to define the National Railway Network (NRWN) to be stored and maintained in GeoGratis. The project’s goal was to define a national standard for railway network spatial and attribute information.
The NRWN project involved extensive consultation with information owners of railway geospatial datasets from both Private and Public sectors. At the same time, the MNRF’s Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) program re-examined the business needs for their own LIO railway-themed information. As crucial internal business requirements were reflected in the proposed NRWN data standards, SDI launched a project to adapt these into LIO Warehouse Database versions of the NRWN geospatial layers.
As a result of this exercise, seven Ontario Railway Network (ORWN) LIO data classes were implemented to reflect active railway information:
1. ORWN Track (line segment)
2. ORWN Structure Line (line segment)
3. ORWN Structure Point (point feature)
4. ORWN Crossing (point feature)
5. ORWN Station (point feature)
6. ORWN Marker Post (point feature)

As per policy 6.30 a technical paper was drafted by the MNR to provide definitions for key natural heritage and key hydrologic features as described in policies 6.21 and 6.22. The key natural heritage feature natural areas abutting Lake Simcoe is defined in this technical paper. The technical paper was completed by June 2, 2010 and was subject to consultation and approval. The technical paper and therefore the definition for natural areas abutting Lake Simcoe was approved March 2015.

Features were mapped based on the definition for natural areas abutting Lake Simcoe. While it is known that key natural heritage feature policies do not apply in settlement areas, these features were mapped for the entire shoreline area outside the Greenbelt Plan area and First Nation lands. 

Mapping of natural areas abutting Lake Simcoe utilized the recently revised MNR mapping of woodlands and wetlands for the Lake Simcoe watershed. Methodology used by Aurora and Midhurst MNR districts for the Southern Ontario Land Resource Information System (SOLRIS) Phase 1 project was applied to update the woodland, evaluated wetlands and identified wetlands layers utilizing orthophotography acquired in the spring of 2008.

Natural areas abutting Lake Simcoe Definition:
Natural Areas Abutting Lake Simcoe means land that extends from the Lake Simcoe shoreline with natural self sustaining vegetation of any plant form or potential natural community. 

Notwithstanding the above, natural areas abutting Lake Simcoe do not include vegetation communities maintained by anthropogenic-based disturbances (e.g. land for agricultural uses, manicured lawns or ornamental plantings).

Feature Identification 
Natural areas abutting Lake Simcoe are areas of a continuous vegetation community class that have a minimum size of 1 ha and are wholly or partially within the 30 m buffer zone of the Lake Simcoe shoreline. These areas may be a narrow band of vegetation along the shoreline or larger areas, which extend a greater distance from the shoreline. As described in policy 6.31-SA, the MNR and the MOE will map the location of natural areas abutting Lake Simcoe.

For purposes of identifying natural areas abutting Lake Simcoe, vegetation communities separated by an opening of >10 m would be considered separate features. A bisecting opening <10 m wide would not be considered to separate a natural area abutting Lake Simcoe into two features. However, the developed portion (e.g., public road or active rail line) of any bisecting opening will not be included in the calculation of area for natural areas abutting Lake Simcoe.",,,"<p><a href=""http://geo.scholarsportal.info/#r/details/_uri@=9543a6eb-2b65-451e-80d8-ffc96ba682f2"">Access this resource</a> on Scholars Geoportal.</p>",Internet,Water Resources,,,,,,9543a6eb-2b65-451e-80d8-ffc96ba682f2,,,,,

This geospatial dataset provides the locations of Long-Term Care Homes (LTCHs) in Ontario.  LTHCs are designed for people who require the availability of 24-hour nursing care and supervision within a secure setting. In general, long term care homes offer higher levels of personal care and support than those typically offered by either retirement homes or supportive housing. LTHCs are owned and operated by various organizations.  Nursing homes are usually operated by private corporations. Municipal homes for the aged are owned by municipal councils. Many municipalities are required to build a home for the aged in their area, either on their own or in partnership with a neighbouring municipality. Charitable homes are usually owned by non-profit corporations, such as faith, community, ethnic or cultural groups.

PLEASE EXERCISE CAUTION WHEN USING THIS PRODUCT. THE DATA NO LONGER REPRESENTS THE CURRENT STATE OF OUR WATER RESOURCES.
This Arc Hydro Quaternary Session Data product (referred to this point forward as 'AH product') represents a historical snapshot in time of our base and derived data products. Generally, this product complies with the Version 2.x.x series of our derived hydrology data (DEM, EFDIR, and Waterflow) before August 1, 2009; versions which are no longer supported or updated by SDI. Watercourse and waterbody geometry were largely based on data extracted from LIO in 2007/08 prior to the release of the Ontario Hydro Network (OHN). All these data products have been superseded by our current OHN and Ontario Integrated Hydrology Data (OIHD) products. OIHD is in a format that can directly support data analysis in environments such as Arc Hydro. You will find many similarities between the OIHD and AH products, but OIHD is also open for other uses as well outside of Arc Hydro.
Because the AH product represents an ideal synthesis of our older versioned data, it will continue to be available for future reference and can be used for comparison with our newer products (eg. for change detection purposes). Users may also benefit from the finer raster resolution available in this AH product (10m/20m raster cell size versus our currently supported 30m products) especially in areas where there has been exceptional OBM DTM coverage. However, the user should be aware that this data may no longer reflect the current changes across the landscape. For data currency, please refer to the OIHD product.
The AH product contains the following datasets, which have all been REPLACED by newer products (see their respective metadata for details):
-	'Water Virtual Flow - Seamless Provincial Data Set' >> comparable to the new 'EnhancedWatercourse' component of OIHD
-	 'Waterbody Segment' >> comparable to the current 'OHN Waterbody' dataset
-	 'Enhanced Flow Direction Grid - Provincial' >> comparable to the 'EnhancedFlowDirection' component of OIHD 
The AH product also utilized the currently RETIRED 'Provincial DEM v2.0.0' (Enforced DEM) as a source for all the derived raster products. Because the DEM was not stored within the AH product, you can still access the retired DEM from LIO if you so desire. The limitations of the DEM v2.x.x dataset described in the following document also naturally apply to the AH product as well.
Arc Hydro (AH) is a geospatial and temporal data model for water resources, which operates within ArcGIS and was developed by the GIS in Water Resources (GISWR) Consortium in the United States. The Consortium is comprised of several members including:
- Government agencies - US Geological Survey and the Environmental Protection Agency,
- Academia - Center for Research in Water Resources, University of Texas,
- Professional partners - Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI). 
AH consists of a set of tools used to create and support a comprehensive water resources framework for hydrologic and related geospatial data analysis. The original focus of Arc Hydro was to support surface water modeling, but work has progressed into the groundwater realm. ESRI plans to link the two systems into one complete data modeling framework in the near future.
The Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry - Water Resources Information Program (WRIP) was involved in a multi-year project to develop standardized Arc Hydro surface water data sessions based on the Quaternary Watershed fabric for the Province of Ontario. Each session contains foundation layers required for fundamental hydrologic watershed analysis.
To meet the requirements of Arc Hydro, the project team followed rigorous quality checking and assurance procedures which resulted in extensive and significant base data improvements across the Province. These enhancements are regarded collectively as a 'snapshot' version of our hydrology base and derivative products. Base data updates are happening on a continual basis, which will have implications on any derivative or related product that has been produced to date by the Province. Any further work in Arc Hydro will depend on available resources and support from the various business areas interested in utilizing these data and tools. 
Some key elements of the project include:
- Basic terrain preprocessing developed for each Arc Hydro session populating the Drainage and Network components of the model. 
- Setting up a Regional ID framework to manage Arc Hydro's HydroID at the Provincial level.
- The concepts of Global Delineation and Thresholding explored for complex quaternary sessions and nested watershed scenarios.
- Leveraging the WRIP water flow network in Arc Hydro analysis.
Additional Time Period Information: The base data products were continually QA/QC'ed and updated as the Arc Hydro Project progressed to ensure spatial integrity across all layers and derivative products. Certain areas of the Province were completed at different periods of time since 2006 and have been versioned internally within WRIP. Generally, these AH products comply with Version 2.x.x of our base hydrology products (DEM, EFDIR, and Waterflow) before August 1, 2009.

Very little effort was made to identify shoals and other hazards when creating these bathymetric maps. Since the data was collected a number of both constructed and naturally occurring events may have resulted in the depth information becoming inaccurate.  For this reason the historic bathymetric maps should not be used for navigational purposes.

In many cases, these maps still represent the only authoritative source of bathymetry data for lakes in Ontario. These maps are being converted to digital GIS line data which can be found in the Bathymetry Line data class. The Bathymetry Index data class identifies if GIS vector lines have been created.

The Wetland data class provides a spatial representation and attribute information for wetlands in Ontario.
 
Not all wetlands have been identified and mapped. Active maintenance is ongoing throughout the province. The currency and accuracy of the spatial representation is variable and requires on-the-ground verification.

Many attribute fields were added in 2012. Values will be added to these fields over time. Refer to the Wetland User Guide for details on using the data.
 
Certain attributes identify which wetlands have been evaluated with the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES) and of those which ones have been designated as Provincially Significant wetlands (PSW). 

Previous to 2011 this data class contained only Evaluated Wetland data. In the spring of 2011 through the Wetland Consolidation project business areas were consulted to identify the best available existing MNR wetland data for each MNR district. The resulting data were added to this data class where it did not overlap existing Evaluated Wetland data. Sources for wetland data included Wetland Interim (OBM/NTS), Forest Resource Inventory (FRI), Southern Ontario Land 
Recourse Inventory System (SOLRIS) and MNRF district data. 

Wetlands are lands that are seasonally or permanently flooded by shallow water as well as lands where the water table is close to the surface; in either case the presence of abundant water causes the formation of hydric (moist) soils and has favoured the dominance of either hydrophytic (water loving) or water tolerant plants. 

An individual spatial polygon represents a discrete wetland type. Values for wetland types are marsh, fen, swamp, bog, treed peatland, open water or unknown. Evaluated Wetlands are those identified and assessed using the technical criteria in the OWES manuals. An evaluation may be for either an Evaluated Wetland or an Evaluated Wetland Complex. Not all wetlands in Ontario have been evaluated. An Evaluated Wetland consists of one or more adjacent (contiguous) wetland polygons. An Evaluated Wetland Complex is a group of separated wetland polygons that have similar or complementary biological, social and/or hydrological functions, are located in close proximity, and are functionally linked (ecologically or hydrologically). An Evaluated Wetland Complex may contain adjacent wetland polygons but must comprise at least one separated wetland polygon. Wetlands that meet certain criteria through OWES are designated as PSWs. 

The wetland polygons are managed independently from other hydro data classes and may overlap waterbodies or other hydro data. 

Due to the changing landscape in the south western portion of the province and the vintage of available source data, MNRF Aylmer district chose not to add some of the unevaluated wetland data from other sources to the existing Wetland Unit layer during the Wetland Consolidation Project of 2011. The Far North Hudson Bay Lowlands and surrounding area have been updated as of March 31 2013. 

Legislated or Legal Authority for Collection: The OWES evaluation information is collected to support the wetlands component of the Provincial Policy Statement. OWES data collection began in the early 1980's and will be on-going. Wetland evaluations are subject to changes as more information becomes available.

In 2009, the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF), along with other Canadian Provincial counterparts were invited to participate in a Natural Resources Canada (NRCAN) initiative to define the National Railway Network (NRWN) to be stored and maintained in GeoGratis. The project’s goal was to define a national standard for railway network spatial and attribute information.
The NRWN project involved extensive consultation with information owners of railway geospatial datasets from both Private and Public sectors. At the same time, the MNRF’s Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) program re-examined the business needs for their own LIO railway-themed information. As crucial internal business requirements were reflected in the proposed NRWN data standards, SDI launched a project to adapt these into LIO Warehouse Database versions of the NRWN geospatial layers.
As a result of this exercise, seven Ontario Railway Network (ORWN) LIO data classes were implemented to reflect active railway information:
1. ORWN Track (line segment)
2. ORWN Structure Line (line segment)
3. ORWN Structure Point (point feature)
4. ORWN Crossing (point feature)
5. ORWN Station (point feature)
6. ORWN Marker Post (point feature)
7. ORWN Junction (point feature)

The ORDSM was generated using data sourced from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), which collected Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (IfSAR). The Space Shuttle Endeavor mission performed a single pass radar interferometry from two antennae mounted 60 m apart with a swath width of 225 km. Orbiting the Earth 176 times during the 11 day mission, the SRTM successfully captured radar data for over 80% of the Earth’s land surface. A more detailed description of the SRTM mission, including publically available data, can be found here -  (https://lta.cr.usgs.gov/SRTM1Arc). 
The horizontal extent of the Ontario Radar DSM provides continuous spatial coverage between the southern-most extent of the province (41 degrees latitude) and north to 57 degrees latitude. 
The horizontal coordinate system of the Ontario Radar DSM is converted from a Geographic Coordinate System to MNRF Lambert Conformal Conic projection. The horizontal datum of the Ontario Radar DSM is North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83).  
The elevation vertical datum of the Ontario Radar DSM is based on two different systems: 
•	Canadian Geodetic Vertical Datum 1928 (CGVD28), which is the current national and provincial elevation data standard. GRS80 for NAD83 is used as the reference ellipsoid.
•	Earth Gravitational Model 1996 (EGM96), which is used by the source data. WGS84 reference ellipsoid is used.
The Ontario Radar DSM has been interpolated at a consistent linear spatial resolution and geospatial coordinate system similar to other MNRF elevation products, which allows for seamless integration.
 Elevations are orthometric and expressed in reference to Mean Sea Level (MSL).  
Units of measures are in meters.",,,"<p><a href=""http://geo.scholarsportal.info/#r/details/_uri@=afd406c4-8e9b-4511-827a-ba16628e4b0f"">Access this resource</a> on Scholars Geoportal.</p>",Internet,Topography,,,,,,afd406c4-8e9b-4511-827a-ba16628e4b0f,,,,,

In 1968 the Department of Lands and Forests initiated the Aquatic Habitat Inventory Program to collect information for Ontario’s inland water data.  One product was a series of contour maps showing lake depth. In many cases, these maps still represent the only authoritative source of bathymetry data for lakes in Ontario. These maps have been converted to digital GIS data which has resulted in the vast majority of the current data in the Bathymetry Line data class. 
More recent bathymetric data has been collected using sonar and GPS technology. This modern technique creates lake depth points (spot depths) rather than contours. This point data is stored in the Bathymetry Point data class.

The Bathymetry Index contains polygons representing the boundaries of all lakes that have bathymetry populated in the Bathymetry Line data class.  Limited metadata information unique to each lake such as the survey year, survey method and scale of original map is included with the polygons.  The polygons have been copied from OHN but do not necessarily represent the actual extent of bathymetric mapping within a given lake (bathymetric mapping could be larger or smaller than polygon extents).

The Forest Fires Prevention Act, R.S.O, 1994, Sec 21(1) indicates that Inside the Fire Region (IFR) municipalities are responsible to suppress grass, brush or forest fires within their municipal boundaries.

By policy, however, AFFES must ensure that every fire in Ontario receives a response, and every response is governed by:  the predicted behaviour of the fire; the potential impacts on people, property or other values; and the estimated cost of each response. Consequently, OMNR enters into fire management agreements with municipalities in the IFR to ensure that municipal and OMNR responsibilities are met and fires are suppressed in a timely fashion. 

Fire management agreements divide the land into four areas including:
1. Crown Protection Area (CPA): The Crown is responsible for responding to incidents and suppressing of all fires in the CPA.

2. Municipal Protection Area (MPA): The municipality is responsible for responding to incidents and the suppression of all fires in the MPA.

3. Federal Protection Area (FPA): The federal government is responsible for responding to incidents and the suppression of all fires in the FPA.

In 2002, the spatial data was updated using NRVIS drainage polygon data including islands from Great Lakes, St. Lawrence, and Ottawa River, and more detailed shoreline data.  NTS mapping was also used to delineate the northern, eastern (Quebec border), and western (Manitoba border) boundaries of the province. In 2006, the shorelins of the Great Lakes, St. Lawrence, and Ottawa River were removed and the effected polygon boundaries were extended out over the water bodies to the extent of the provincial boundary.  This modification was undertaken to provide a more generic data layer which is intended to be used as a selection tool, and as a backdrop upon which evolving and multi scalar hydorology layers may be overlain or intersected.

For example, signs are often posted at intervals along a railway Subdivision indicating the distance from its point of origin in miles or kilometres.
 
In 2009, the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF), along with other Canadian Provincial counterparts were invited to participate in a Natural Resources Canada (NRCAN) initiative to define the National Railway Network (NRWN) to be stored and maintained in GeoGratis. The project’s goal was to define a national standard for railway network spatial and attribute information.
The NRWN project involved extensive consultation with information owners of railway geospatial datasets from both Private and Public sectors. At the same time, the MNRF’s Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) program re-examined the business needs for their own LIO railway-themed information. As crucial internal business requirements were reflected in the proposed NRWN data standards, SDI launched a project to adapt these into LIO Warehouse Database versions of the NRWN geospatial layers.
As a result of this exercise, seven Ontario Railway Network (ORWN) LIO data classes were implemented to reflect active railway information:
1. ORWN Track (line segment)
2. ORWN Structure Line (line segment)
3. ORWN Structure Point (point feature)
4. ORWN Crossing (point feature)
5. ORWN Station (point feature)
6. ORWN Marker Post (point feature)
7. ORWN Junction (point feature)
It should be noted that NRWN is not comprehensive and it is expected that as NRWN geospatial layers are revised by NRCAN, the ORWN will be updated shortly thereafter.",,,"<p><a href=""http://geo.scholarsportal.info/#r/details/_uri@=6114167f-ba00-446e-bd5e-49b0cb2581b7"">Access this resource</a> on Scholars Geoportal.</p>",Internet,Transportation,,,,,,6114167f-ba00-446e-bd5e-49b0cb2581b7,,,,,

The dataset was based on the concept that Sustainable Forest Licence holders would maintain forest inventory information for lands licenced to them and the Ministry of Natural Resources would maintain the forest inventory information for all other lands. 
Due to the short timeframe and minimal resources for gathering all the information across the province during that period, a limited effort was made to check the attribute values for information supplied by the SFL or information supplied by the MNR. Cursory range checks were made at the time of data load to ensure that attribute entries were valid. At the time of data collection, more effort was placed into ensuring that the forest stand boundaries aligned with the official polygon water layer.
A number of factors lead to improved forest inventory management principles.
In the Autumn of 2006, MNR announced the enhanced Forest Resources Inventory program which included an expanded geographic scope, increased funding scale, a new delivery mechanism, a new governance structure, technological enhancements and revitalized production processes.

The structure of the standard attribute table for a coverage is as follows:

These derivatives can be used by a variety of users and applied to many water-related applications.
Using a base map for reference, the OFAT user defines a watershed drainage point on a mapped hydrology feature such as a stream, river, or lake anywhere within the land boundary of Ontario, including Ontario’s Far North. The resulting watershed polygon can then be used within OFAT to summarize key watershed characteristics. The watershed boundary and characteristics are used in Flood Flow, Low Flow, and Mean Annual Flow models.

For further information on the rationale for the revisions, refer to  Ecoregions of Ontario  Modifications to Angus Hills Site Regions and Districts, Revisions and Rationale, Crins and Uhlig 2000 .  In 2002, the spatial data was updated using NRVIS drainage polygon data including islands from Great Lakes, St. Lawrence, and Ottawa River, and more detailed shoreline data.  NTS mapping was also used to delineate the northern, eastern (Quebec border), and western (Manitoba border) boundaries of the province. In 2006, the shorelins of the Great Lakes, St. Lawrence, and Ottawa River were removed and the effected polygon boundaries were extended out over the water bodies to the extent of the provincial boundary.  This modification was undertaken to provide a more generic data layer which is intended to be used as a selection tool, and as a backdrop upon which evolving and multi scalar hydorology layers may be overlain or intersected.

It identifies high quality natural cover areas that are 25 hectares or greater within the Lake Simcoe watershed. 
Natural cover includes areas that have been mapped as woodlands (including plantations and hedgerows), wetlands and other rare vegetative cover communities. High quality with respect to natural cover means that the cover demonstrates a number of characteristics that influence the functional ability of a feature such as shape, age, structure and area of cover (LSPP 2009). As stated in the policy, areas of high quality natural cover must be 25 hectares or greater. Natural cover features were merged and internal boundaries dissolved to obtain continuous natural cover polygons before their size was determined. Subsequently, natural cover polygons with an area smaller than 25 ha were excluded. Other patch-based metrics that characterize polygons based on their spatial characteristics and their surrounding matrix were not used to further exclude features because of the uncertainty surrounding their interpretation without referencing information that is not currently available. Ideally, natural cover quality should be evaluated through site level assessment, which would enable determining whether a natural cover feature has structural and compositional characteristics that indicate it serves ecological functions at a higher level when compared to other natural cover features. Given that it is not feasible to perform the required site level evaluations for all natural cover features that are 25 hectares or greater in the watershed, identification, in the near term was restricted to the size criteria only. Natural cover features beyond the Lake Simcoe Protection Act watershed boundary were considered when calculating the total area for continuous natural cover areas. As long as the area is 25 ha or greater and a portion of the area is within the Lake Simcoe watershed it is included in the identified areas of high quality natural cover that are 25 hectares or greater in the watershed.",,,"<p><a href=""http://geo.scholarsportal.info/#r/details/_uri@=b8a5f778-0c27-4ed0-a2eb-972dd6dc81d1"">Access this resource</a> on Scholars Geoportal.</p>",Internet,Water Resources,,,,,,b8a5f778-0c27-4ed0-a2eb-972dd6dc81d1,,,,,

The objectives for compiling an inventory of the Lake Simcoe shoreline were to 1) better understand the current state of the shoreline, 2) track changes over time, if the inventory is repeated in the future and 3) assist in identifying priority areas for restoration.

In 2015, the Provincial Geomatics Service Centre (PGSC) in Peterborough updated the shoreline mapping for Lake Simcoe. The shoreline mapping methodology which had been previously used, was revised by reducing the number of shoreline classifications and simplifying the attributes being captured.
 
Orthophoto imagery (2013) was used as the digitizing base, while oblique imagery, taken late fall 2014, was used to assist with shoreline feature interpretation. Attribute fields were added to facilitate change detection analysis with previous shoreline mapping efforts, which had been based on 2008/2009 orthophoto imagery. The shoreline was mapped using a combination of linear shoreline features, shoreline alteration footprints, and offshore features. The eight shoreline classifications were further grouped into a natural, altered, or beach/bar class.

Several partners were involved with the project, including: Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, Environment Canada, Ontario Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change, Severn Sound Environmental Association, Nottawasaga Valley Conservation Authority, Lake Simcoe Region Conservation Authority, and County of Simcoe.

Purpose:  The Lake Simcoe shoreline mapping was updated to fulfill the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry's (MNRF) obligations under the Lake Simcoe Protection Plan to monitor change in natural and altered shoreline.",,,"<p><a href=""http://geo.scholarsportal.info/#r/details/_uri@=1fcc75a2-ec19-465d-8d24-f9abc1fbf7ab"">Access this resource</a> on Scholars Geoportal.</p>",Internet,Water Resources,,,,,,1fcc75a2-ec19-465d-8d24-f9abc1fbf7ab,,,,,

A Junction may be located at the intersection of three or more sets of tracks; at the track end; at the transition of a national, provincial, or territorial boundary; and at the beginning and end of a track subdivision.

In 2009, the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF), along with other Canadian Provincial counterparts were invited to participate in a Natural Resources Canada (NRCAN) initiative to define the National Railway Network (NRWN) to be stored and maintained in GeoGratis. The project’s goal was to define a national standard for railway network spatial and attribute information.
The NRWN project involved extensive consultation with information owners of railway geospatial datasets from both Private and Public sectors. At the same time, the MNRF’s Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) program re-examined the business needs for their own LIO railway-themed information. As crucial internal business requirements were reflected in the proposed NRWN data standards, SDI launched a project to adapt these into LIO Warehouse Database versions of the NRWN geospatial layers.
As a result of this exercise, seven Ontario Railway Network (ORWN) LIO data classes were implemented to reflect active railway information:
1. ORWN Track (line segment)
2. ORWN Structure Line (line segment)
3. ORWN Structure Point (point feature)
4. ORWN Crossing (point feature)
5. ORWN Station (point feature)
6. ORWN Marker Post (point feature)

PLEASE EXERCISE CAUTION WHEN USING THIS PRODUCT. THE DATA NO LONGER REPRESENTS THE CURRENT STATE OF OUR WATER RESOURCES.
The Enhanced Flow Direction Grid  is a collection of related elevation and mapped water features that are used in combination for generating watersheds and to support hydrology applications.
The Enhanced Flow Direction Grid is a grid representing surface flow directions derived from Version 2.0 Digital Elevation Model (DEM) with the added enhancement of having the photogrammetrically mapped hydrology (WRIP Water Virtual Flow and NRVIS water body segment) embedded within the grid so that known hydrology is accurately represented within the grid. 
Also included in version 2 is an alternative assignment of flow direction to shoreline areas. The inclusion has the following effects: Brings the limit of the Flow Direction grid closer to the shoreline resulting in a cleaner product; Allows for the delineation of distinct shoreline catchments not possible in the previous EFD product; Minimizes effects of shoreline bleeding (erroneous catchments being formed in -no-data- areas usually upstream of project areas); and Assigns proper flow directions to minor bays and inlets.
To cover Ontario the grid has been divided  into 16 pieces, existing in their respective UTM zones 15, 16, 17, and 18.   Each grid covers major watersheds within these zones.  The naming conventions of the grid follow the naming conventions of the Secondary and Tertiary Provincial watershed layers.  The resolution of the Enhanced Flow Direction Grid is the same as the Provincial Digital Elevation Model - 10m for southern Ontario (where 1:10,000 base data exists) and 20m for Northern Ontario (where 1:20,000 base data exists).

This geospatial dataset provides the location of Family Health Team locations in Ontario.  

Family Health Teams (FHT) are community-centred primary care organizations whose programs and services are geared to the population groups they serve. FHTs provide primary care services to rural, urban, and unique populations of patients with both typical and specialized health needs. They include a team of family physicians, nurse practitioners, registered nurses, social workers, dietitians, and other professionals who work together to provide primary health care for their community. FHTs were created to expand access to comprehensive family health care services across Ontario.

This dataset includes the FHT’s main office locations as well as the practice locations of the family physicians affiliated with the Family Health Teams. A physician can practice at more than one location however only their primary address is included in this dataset.

The MOHLTC Sub-region Cartographic Boundary File is an ESRI geodatabase / layer file that includes the boundaries for all of Ontario’s 76 sub-regions for use in Geographic Information Systems (GIS). This file should be used for the display of sub-region boundaries and not to select Census geography for analysis.

In October 2016, each LHIN submitted a Guide to Formalizing LHIN Sub-Regions to the MOHLTC. This document included a description of the geography of the LHIN’s sub-regions. HAB used these descriptions to build geographic boundaries using standard 2011 census components (Census Subdivisions and Dissemination Areas), or used the GIS files supplied by the LHIN.

In more rural areas of the North East and North West LHINs, sub-region boundaries are not based on Census components because it was not possible to create large contiguous areas. HAB worked with both LHINs to refine the boundaries in these areas. Since this boundary file does not correspond to Census geography in all areas of the province, we refer to it as a ‘cartographic’ file.

The file is supplied as a polygon feature class in an ESRI File Geodatabase (FGDB) or as an ESRI Shapefile. The co-ordinate system of the file is GCS North American 1983.

",Various geospatial formats available.,Public,"<p><a href=""http://geo.scholarsportal.info/#r/details/_uri@=5383ed26-4a12-4026-b624-65c2e431c861"">Access this resource</a> on Scholars Geoportal.</p>","<p>The Ontario Integrated Hydrology Data is a collection of related elevation and mapped water features that are used in combination for generating watersheds and to support hydrology applications. Four key datasets are represented in each data package: i) a stream network (EnhancedWatercourse), ii) a hydrology-enforced DEM (EnforcedDEM), iii) a flow direction grid (EnhancedFlowDirection), and a raster representation of the stream network (StreamGrid). The IH_ReferenceData.gdb which is attached to this metadata record contains spatial metadata of data package extents, update status and elevation sources. The physical data is distributed as 9 separate data packages which are assembled by watershed area as illustrated in the ‘Extent of Data Packages for Ontario Integrated Hydrology’ document attached to this metadata record. Integrated hydrology data is complete for the entire province. Users can create complete watershed boundaries for any location within Ontario with the following exceptions: points on the International Border, points within water bodies on the International Border (eg. Rainy River, Great Lakes, and St. Lawrence River) and points in the Ottawa River. A separate unenforced Provincial DEM has been created for users requiring spatial data that more closely represents true ground elevations. The Provincial DEM is packaged separately from the Ontario Integrated Hydrology Data and is available through the LIO warehouse. For more detailed information please see the 'Ontario Integrated Hydrology Data User Guide' document attached to this metadata record.</p>
