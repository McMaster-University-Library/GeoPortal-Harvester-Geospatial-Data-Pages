The MOHLTC Sub-region Cartographic Boundary File is an ESRI geodatabase / layer file that includes the boundaries for all of Ontario’s 76 sub-regions for use in Geographic Information Systems (GIS). This file should be used for the display of sub-region boundaries and not to select Census geography for analysis.

In October 2016, each LHIN submitted a Guide to Formalizing LHIN Sub-Regions to the MOHLTC. This document included a description of the geography of the LHIN’s sub-regions. HAB used these descriptions to build geographic boundaries using standard 2011 census components (Census Subdivisions and Dissemination Areas), or used the GIS files supplied by the LHIN.

In more rural areas of the North East and North West LHINs, sub-region boundaries are not based on Census components because it was not possible to create large contiguous areas. HAB worked with both LHINs to refine the boundaries in these areas. Since this boundary file does not correspond to Census geography in all areas of the province, we refer to it as a ‘cartographic’ file.

The file is supplied as a polygon feature class in an ESRI File Geodatabase (FGDB) or as an ESRI Shapefile. The co-ordinate system of the file is GCS North American 1983. Field descriptions and additional information are included in the FGDB or Shapefile metadata.",,,"<p><a href=""http://geo.scholarsportal.info/#r/details/_uri@=86746bcd-4ba3-4982-9961-f1ca8fa04eb4"">Access this resource</a> on Scholars Geoportal.</p>",Internet,, ,,,,,86746bcd-4ba3-4982-9961-f1ca8fa04eb4,,,,,,,

It was designed for the storage of such information as the location of waterpower sites, waterpower developments, storage reservoirs, stream measurement stations, and meteorological stations. The Water Survey of Canada delineations involved the division, sub-division and sub-sub-division of Canada into suitably sized areas based on the drainage, for administrative purposes. Although the boundaries are based on drainage, the intent was to include all of Canada's land mass and waters within this drainage area hierarchy to facilitate the identification of hydrometeorological sites. Therefore, the WSC drainage areas do not necessarily define individual river basins, but can represent intervening areas along the coast or include islands.' (National Scale Frameworks HYDROLOGY Version 5.0, NRCan, 2003)</p><p>ABOUT THIS RELEASE: These boundaries have been created based on the recent Version 2 Provincial DEM and Enhanced Flow Direction products released 2006-2008. The generation of the boundaries also involved some enhanced interpolation and smoothing techniques to produce a final product that is consistent with the current regional hydrology available for Ontario.

The geology of the Province consists of Precambrian rocks of the Canadian Shield and Phanerozoic sedimentary rocks in basins that overlie the Canadian Shield. Based on differences in age, metamorphism and tectonic setting, the Precambrian rocks are subdivided into the Superior, Southern and Grenville provinces. The Phanerozoic rocks occur in four basins. Major faults and shear zones are also included. The legend is subdivided geochronologically in the Phanerozoic, but geochronometrically in the Proterozoic and Archean. The Archean rocks of the Superior Province are subdivided into lithologic units. Supracrustal units of the Southern Province and the Phanerozoic Eon are subdivided lithostratigraphically. The Grenville Province is subdivided into major tectonic blocks and within each block the legend is mainly lithologic, with only part of the supracrustal rock record subdivided into lithostratigraphic units.
