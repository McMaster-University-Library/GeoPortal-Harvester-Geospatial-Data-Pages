The orthophotography has a pixel resolution of 20 centimetres and is accurate within 60 centimetres on the ground at 95% confidence. It is provided as 8-bit depth GeoTIFF and compressed GeoTIFF files. The imagery was acquired by an Vexcel UltraCam X and Vexcel UltraCam X Prime digital cameras and was later orthorectified using an elevation dataset generated through image correlation. </p> <p>Imagery was captured from April 2nd to June 1st, 2021. The project encompassed an area of approximately 49,540 square kilometres covering Central Ontario, including Timmins, Temiskaming Shores, Greater Sudbury, Elliot Lake, North Bay, Lake Nipissing, and Manitoulin Island. This aerial project is part of a five-year plan (2018-2022) to acquire high resolution, leaf-off imagery across the province.</p> <p>Orthoimagery are available in 1km by 1km coverage tiles. A stereo frame index shapefile will be available in 2022 through Land Information Ontario's GeoHUB.</p> <p> <b>Compressed GeoTIFFs:</b> These images are JPEG-compressed GeoTIFFs, and are suitable for analysis in many cases. Should you require uncompressed TIFF files, these may be requested for download by contacting geoportal@scholarsportal.info, and providing your name and institution (ex. University of Guelph).</p> <p><b>Please note:</b> Due to the size of these tiles (~500 MB each), please request a portion of the data only.

The orthophotography has a pixel resolution of 16cm and is accurate to 45 centimetres on the ground at 95%. The imagery was acquired by an Vexcel UltraCam X and Vexcel UltraCam X Prime digital cameras and was later orthorectified using an elevation dataset generated through image correlation. </p> <p>Imagery was captured from March 7th to May 20th, 2020. The project encompassed an area of approximately 44,828 square kilometers covering South Western Ontario, including Windsor, London, Hamilton, Niagara, Owen Sound, the Bruce Peninsula and surrounding areas. This aerial project is part of a five-year plan (2018-2022) to acquire 16 cm resolution, leaf-off imagery across the province.</p> <p>Orthoimagery are available in 1km by 1km coverage tiles. (Stereo data is also available through Land Information Ontario.)</p> <p><b>Compressed GeoTIFFs:</b> These images are JPEG-compressed GeoTIFFs, and are suitable for analysis in many cases. Should you require uncompressed TIFF files, these may be requested for download by contacting geoportal@scholarsportal.info, and providing your name and institution (ex. University of Guelph).</p> <p><b>Please note:</b> Due to the size of these tiles (~500 MB each), please request a portion of the data only.

The orthophotography covers 36,103 sq km, has a pixel resolution of 16cm and is accurate to 45 centimetres on the ground at 95%. The imagery was acquired by an Vexcel UltraCam X and Vexcel UltraCamEagle digital cameras and was later orthorectified using an elevation dataset generated through image correlation.</p><p><b>Compressed GeoTIFFs:</b> These images are JPEG-compressed GeoTIFFs, and are suitable for analysis in many cases. Should you require uncompressed TIFF files, these may be requested for download by contacting geoportal@scholarsportal.info, and providing your name and institution (ex. University of Guelph).</p><p> <u>Please note:</u> Due to the size of these tiles (~500 MB each), please request a portion of the data only. This can be done by including a polygon file of the study area, a description of a desired feature/area (ex.
