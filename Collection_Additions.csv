Four key datasets are represented in each data package: i) a stream network (EnhancedWatercourse), ii) a hydrology-enforced DEM (EnforcedDEM), iii) a flow direction grid (EnhancedFlowDirection), and a raster representation of the stream network (StreamGrid). The IH_ReferenceData.gdb which is attached to this metadata record contains spatial metadata of data package extents, update status and elevation sources.  The physical data is distributed as 9 separate data packages which are assembled by watershed area as illustrated in the ‘Extent of Data Packages for Ontario Integrated Hydrology’ document attached to this metadata record.
Integrated hydrology data is complete for the entire province. Users can create complete watershed boundaries for any location within Ontario with the following exceptions: points on the International Border, points within water bodies on the International Border (eg. Rainy River, Great Lakes, and St. Lawrence River) and points in the Ottawa River.
A separate unenforced Provincial DEM has been created for users requiring spatial data that more closely represents true ground elevations. The Provincial DEM is packaged separately from the Ontario Integrated Hydrology Data and is available through the LIO warehouse.
For more detailed information please see the 'Ontario Integrated Hydrology Data User Guide' document attached to this metadata record.",,,"<p><a href=""http://geo.scholarsportal.info/#r/details/_uri@=5383ed26-4a12-4026-b624-65c2e431c861"">Access this resource</a> on Scholars Geoportal.</p>",Internet,Water Resources, ,grid,https://www.javacoeapp.lrc.gov.on.ca/geonetwork/srv/en/resources.get.thumbnail?id=13225&access=public&fname=MetadataThumb.png,,,5383ed26-4a12-4026-b624-65c2e431c861,,,,,,,
