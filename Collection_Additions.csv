It was designed for the storage of such information as the location of waterpower sites, waterpower developments, storage reservoirs, stream measurement stations, and meteorological stations. The Water Survey of Canada delineations involved the division, sub-division and sub-sub-division of Canada into suitably sized areas based on the drainage, for administrative purposes. Although the boundaries are based on drainage, the intent was to include all of Canada's land mass and waters within this drainage area hierarchy to facilitate the identification of hydrometeorological sites. Therefore, the WSC drainage areas do not necessarily define individual river basins, but can represent intervening areas along the coast or include islands.' (National Scale Frameworks HYDROLOGY Version 5.0, NRCan, 2003)</p><p>ABOUT THIS RELEASE: These boundaries have been created based on the recent Version 2 Provincial DEM and Enhanced Flow Direction products released 2006-2008. The generation of the boundaries also involved some enhanced interpolation and smoothing techniques to produce a final product that is consistent with the current regional hydrology available for Ontario. Watershed naming conventions have also been revised to be more closely in line with Federal names where appropriate.</p>",,"<p>Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources. <em>Watershed</em> [digital resource: vector].

It illustrates geological rock types, major faults, iron formations, kimberlite intrusions, and dike swarms. The geology of the Province consists of Precambrian rocks of the Canadian Shield and Phanerozoic sedimentary rocks in basins that overlie the Canadian Shield. Based on differences in age, metamorphism and tectonic setting, the Precambrian rocks are subdivided into the Superior, Southern and Grenville provinces. The Phanerozoic rocks occur in four basins. Major faults and shear zones are also included. The legend is subdivided geochronologically in the Phanerozoic, but geochronometrically in the Proterozoic and Archean. The Archean rocks of the Superior Province are subdivided into lithologic units. Supracrustal units of the Southern Province and the Phanerozoic Eon are subdivided lithostratigraphically. The Grenville Province is subdivided into major tectonic blocks and within each block the legend is mainly lithologic, with only part of the supracrustal rock record subdivided into lithostratigraphic units.
