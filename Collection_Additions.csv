<p>""The National Broadband Data represents coverage information across Canada for existing broadband service providers with their associated technology types. The coverage information is aggregated and deployed over a grid of hexagons, which cover areas of roughly 25 square km each. Broadband Internet service availability is provided for download/upload speed markers (5/1, 10/2, 25/5 and 50/10 Mbps) where more than 75% of total dwellings covered within the hexagon have access to broadband service offerings meeting these markers.</p>
<p>In order to improve the granularity of the broadband data, ISED and the CRTC are providing aggregated and anonymous broadband services data based on the pseudo-household statistical model, hence achieving higher precision in depicting the broadband Internet service availability. This information is available under the ""NBD PHH Speeds"" resource. For more information on the pseudo-household statistical model, refer to the <a href=""https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/b3a1d603-19ca-466c-ae95-b5185e56addf"">Pseudo-Household Demographic Distribution dataset</a>.</p>

<p>The High Resolution Digital Elevation Model (HRDEM) product is derived from airborne LiDAR data (mainly in the south) and satellite images in the north. The complete coverage of the Canadian territory is gradually being established. It includes a Digital Terrain Model (DTM), a Digital Surface Model (DSM) and other derived data. For DTM datasets, derived data available are slope, aspect, shaded relief, color relief and color shaded relief maps and for DSM datasets, derived data available are shaded relief, color relief and color shaded relief maps.</p>
<p>The productive forest line is used to separate the northern and the southern parts of the country. This line is approximate and may change based on requirements. In the southern part of the country (south of the productive forest line), DTM and DSM datasets are generated from airborne LiDAR data. They are offered at a 1 m or 2 m resolution and projected to the UTM NAD83 (CSRS) coordinate system and the corresponding zones. The datasets at a 1 m resolution cover an area of 10 km x 10 km while datasets at a 2 m resolution cover an area of 20 km by 20 km. In the northern part of the country (north of the productive forest line), due to the low density of vegetation and infrastructure, only DSM datasets are generally generated. Most of these datasets have optical digital images as their source data. They are generated at a 2 m resolution using the Polar Stereographic North coordinate system referenced to WGS84 horizontal datum or UTM NAD83 (CSRS) coordinate system. Each dataset covers an area of 50 km by 50 km. For some locations in the north, DSM and DTM datasets can also be generated from airborne LiDAR data. In this case, these products will be generated with the same specifications as those generated from airborne LiDAR in the southern part of the country. </p>",<p>Metadata and product specifications available with downloads.</p>,,N/A,Internet,Topography,Canada,Raster,,,,,,,,,

<p>Point cloud files are distributed by LiDAR acquisition project without integration between projects.</p>
<p>The point cloud files are distributed using the compressed .LAZ / Cloud Optimized Point Cloud (COPC) format. The COPC open format is an octree reorganization of the data inside a .LAZ 1.4 file. It allows efficient use and visualization rendering via HTTP calls (e.g. via the web), while offering the capabilities specific to the compressed .LAZ format which is already well established in the industry. Point cloud files are therefore both downloadable for local use and viewable via URL links from a cloud computing environment.</p>
<p>The reference system used for all point clouds in the product is NAD83(CSRS), epoch 2010. The projection used is the UTM projection with the corresponding zone.
