This geospatial dataset provides the location of Family Health Team locations in Ontario.  

Family Health Teams (FHT) are community-centred primary care organizations whose programs and services are geared to the population groups they serve. FHTs provide primary care services to rural, urban, and unique populations of patients with both typical and specialized health needs. They include a team of family physicians, nurse practitioners, registered nurses, social workers, dietitians, and other professionals who work together to provide primary health care for their community. FHTs were created to expand access to comprehensive family health care services across Ontario.

This dataset includes the FHT’s main office locations as well as the practice locations of the family physicians affiliated with the Family Health Teams. A physician can practice at more than one location however only their primary address is included in this dataset.

Note: It is possible that a FHT’s main office has no practicing physicians at that location.",,,"<p><a href=""http://geo.scholarsportal.info/#r/details/_uri@=ca4a97d3-a996-4974-af23-8b2bce02ee28>Access this resource</a> on Scholars Geoportal.</p>",Internet,Location, ,,,,,ca4a97d3-a996-4974-af23-8b2bce02ee28,,,,,,,

The OTN contains networks in urban, rural and wilderness settings managed by a named organization for recreation, active living or tourism purposes. Examples of trails in the OTN include; Hiking, Running and Walking trails; Cycling and Mountain Bike routes; All Terrain Vehicle, Snowmobiling and Dirt Bike trails; X-Country Skiing and Snow shoeing trails; Equestrian trails; and Canoe and Portage Routes.
OTN Trail Segment contains trail segments that define a linear corridor through the natural or urban environment. These corridors may be single segments or form a looping system. One trail segment is distinguished from another trail segment within the same trail by having different features. Linking the OTN Segment to the OTN Trailhead, trail segments are further defined by the characteristics of a trail, e.g. trail name, length etc. 
The OTN project is the combined efforts of trail organizations and three levels of government (Federal, Provincial and Municipal) working to create a common and shared trail infrastructure which is composed trails and their descriptive attributes across the whole of the province.",,,"<p><a href=""http://geo.scholarsportal.info/#r/details/_uri@=de585e6f-ff96-4737-99af-ac26064bf3e2>Access this resource</a> on Scholars Geoportal.</p>",Internet,Human Environment, ,,https://www.javacoeapp.lrc.gov.on.ca/geonetwork/srv/en/resources.get.thumbnail?id=912&access=public&fname=OTNtrailseg.png,,,de585e6f-ff96-4737-99af-ac26064bf3e2,,,,,,,

This geospatial dataset provides the locations of Community Care Access Centres (CCACs) in Ontario.  CCACs are the local organizations established by the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care to provide access to government-funded home and community services and long-term care homes. CCACs work together, and with physicians, hospital teams, and other health care providers to enhance access and co-ordination for people who need care in the community. They help people to live independently at home and apply for admission to a long-term care home.  CCACs also provide information about local community support service agencies and can link people to these agencies to arrange services.

It also indicates the availability of digital inventories from the Land Information Ontario Warehouse (LIOW) as structured (Forest Cover data class) and packaged (zip file) products through the Land Information Data Subscription (LIDS) service.
----------
It is important to note that forest inventories are differentiated by the following two versions or products: 
1) Forest Resources Inventory (FRI): 
This is the initial or first new data capture version of the forest resource inventory for a unit that is delivered to OMNR Districts and Sustainable Forest Licence (SFL) holders. In most cases, it involves the complete re-inventory of the forested land within a unit. It provides a basis for planning inventories described below.
---
2) Planning Composite Inventory (PCI):
Once delivered, the FRI (1) is updated by OMNR Districts and Forest Companies for Forest Management Planning purposes. Spatial and attribute data are updated on an as-required or scheduled basis to reflect changes to the forest landscape (e.g. natural disturbances, harvesting and regeneration). The planning inventory contains additional attributes and information that conform to Forest Information Manual (FIM) standards to support the forest management planning process.
----------
Note: The majority of FRI unit boundaries represented in this layer reflects, and are kept current to the latest version of the Forest Management Unit boundary layer.
----------
For additional information, refer to the NRVIS User Guide for this layer that is available for download on the Land Information Ontario (LIO) website Data in the Warehouse page.
Legislated or Legal Authority for Collection: Supports the Forest Information Manual (FIM) and provides various MNR business areas with fundamental forest inventory information needed to met their program mandates.
Additional Time Period Information: Information regarding the availability of FRI Products will be kept current in this layer as they are made available.
Additional Metadata Location: User Guide for this layer can be downloaded from the LIO Data in the Warehouse page

The OTN contains networks in urban, rural and wilderness settings managed by a named organization for recreation, active living or tourism purposes. Examples of trails in the OTN include; Hiking, Running and Walking trails; Cycling and Mountain Bike routes; All Terrain Vehicle, Snowmobiling and Dirt Bike trails; X-Country Skiing and Snow shoeing trails; Equestrian trails; and Canoe and portage routes.
OTN Trailhead contains trailhead points which describe the characteristics of a trail such as trail name, length, type, permitted use, amenity, and organization. 
OTN Trailhead contains points that represent the location of the start of the trail as well as secondary access points.  A trailhead exists for each trail and may consist of one or more trail segments. By linking the OTN Trailhead to OTN Trail Segment, the linear corridor/linear segment of the trail can be linked to the trailhead.
The OTN project is the combined efforts of trail organizations and three levels of government (Federal, Provincial and Municipal) working to create a common and shared trail infrastructure which is composed trails and their descriptive attributes across the whole of the province.",,,"<p><a href=""http://geo.scholarsportal.info/#r/details/_uri@=ce2148e6-a4c3-48b6-a734-82729f6ff3db>Access this resource</a> on Scholars Geoportal.</p>",Internet,Human Environment, ,,https://www.javacoeapp.lrc.gov.on.ca/geonetwork/srv/en/resources.get.thumbnail?id=913&access=public&fname=OTNTHD.png,,,ce2148e6-a4c3-48b6-a734-82729f6ff3db,,,,,,,
