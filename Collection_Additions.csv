<p>Bathymetry is the measurement of water depth in lakes. From the 1940s to the 1990s, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry produced bathymetry maps for over 11,000 lakes across Ontario.</p>
 
<p>The data can be used by the general public and GIS specialists for:</p>
<ul>
<li>climate chnage modelling</li>
<li>fish monitoring and other ecological applications</li>
<li>hydrologic cycle modelling</li>
<li>recreational fishing maps</li>
<li>watershed-based water budgeting</li>
</ul>
 
<p>The maps were created using simple methods to determine lake depths. They were meant for resource anagement purposes only. Little effort was made to identify shoal and other hazads when creating these bathymetric maps.</p>
 
<p>Since this data was collected, many constructed and naturally occuring events could mean that the depth information is now inaccurate, so these maps should not be used for navigational purposes. In many cases, these maps still represent the only authoritative source of bathymetry data for lakes in Ontario.</p>",<p>A detailed outline of the Ontario Historic Bathymetry Maps metadata can be found at the following link: https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/19b6e1fbfba846cd80a11acda6b9e1d4/info/metadata/metadata.xml?format=default&output=html</p>,"Format: Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry.

The imagery was acquired by an Vexcel UltraCam X and Vexcel UltraCamEagle digital cameras and was later orthorectified using an elevation dataset generated through image correlation.</p><p><b>Compressed GeoTIFFs:</b> These images are JPEG-compressed GeoTIFFs, and are suitable for analysis in many cases. Should you require uncompressed TIFF files, these may be requested for download by contacting geoportal@scholarsportal.info, and providing your name and institution (ex. University of Guelph).</p><p> <u>Please note:</u> Due to the size of these tiles (~500 MB each), please request a portion of the data only. This can be done by including a polygon file of the study area, a description of a desired feature/area (ex. UTM campus), or a screenshot in your e-mail. </p>",,"<p>Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources. <em>Digital Raster Acquisition Project Eastern Ontario (DRAPE) 2019</em> [digital resource: grid].
