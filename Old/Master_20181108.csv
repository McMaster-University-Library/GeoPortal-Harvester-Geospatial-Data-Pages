The map can be exported to an image format (.jpg, e.g.)</p>
<p>Data are also available for download in two formats: MapInfo Interchange Format (MIF) and the proprietary RPN format.  MIF files can be converted to ESRI Shapefile format by using ArcCatalog.  Software is provided on the website for conversion of RPN format files.  Please note that the website requires a username and password to download files, and there is a 160MB/day download limit.</p>

","<p>The map shows the amount of area equipped for irrigation around the turn of the 20th century as a percentage of the total area on a raster with a resolution of 5 arc minutes. The area actually irrigated was smaller, but is unknown for most countries. A special note has to be made for Australia and India where the map shows the total area actually irrigated. This is due to the fact that statistics collected in Australia and India refer to actually irrigated area as opposed to statistics with area equipped for irrigation which are collected in most other countries. An explanation of the different terminology to indicate areas under irrigation is given in a <a href=""http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/irrigationmap/index20.stm"">glossary</a>.</p>
<p>Since 1999 the methodology to produce the map has been improved which made it possible to increase the spatial resolution of the map to 5 arc minutes (about 10 km at the equator). The objective of the cooperation between the Universities and FAO is to develop global GIS coverage of areas equipped for irrigation and to make it available to users in the international community. The data collected through the AQUASTAT surveys will be used to improve the overall quality and resolution of the information.</p>

","<p>The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) was a collaborative effort between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), and the German and Italian space agencies, to generate a near-global digital elevation model (DEM).  The mission homepage is at the NASA website, but the data are publically distributed by the USGS EROS Data Center.</p>
<p>Digital elevation data consists of an ordered array of ground elevations sampled at regular intervals over each grid area.   Aside from estimating point elevations, digital elevation has a variety of applications, including terrain modeling, line of sight analysis, water flow and flooding analysis, and many others.</p>
<p>1 arc second: The most recent version of the SRTM data  has a resolution of 1 arc second, which is about 30m x 30m. The coverage is considered near-global, which means approximately 80% of the Earth's landmass is captured.</p>
<p>3 arc second: For this dataset, 3 arc second refers to the pixel size, which is roughly 90m x 90m.  Each tile has a size of 1201 x 1201 pixels, covering roughly 36km x 36km (e.g. the local tile covers the core area of the Golden Horseshoe).  The files are provided in .bil format, which can be immediately displayed in ArcMap.</p>
<p>30 arc second: A 30 arc second grid roughly translates to a pixel size of 1km x 1km.  These tiles are much larger than the 3 arc second tiles both in coverage and in pixel number.  For example, the ""local"" tile is 4800 x 6000 pixels in size, covering all of Ontario and Quebec, some of Manitoba and Nunavut, and with North-South coverage from the northeastern United States up to Greenland.  The files are provided in .dem format, which can be immediately displayed in ArcMap.</p>

<p><em>""The Tectonic Geology Data Set is a digital interpretation of the Tectonic Geology of the Province of Ontario, It illustrates this by 1) grouping volcanic and sedimentary rock units into tectonic assemblages in Precambrain terrains and depositional sequences in the overlying Paleozoic and Mesozoic sedimentary basins; and 2) interpreting the ranges of emplacement ages of all major intrusions and grouping some plutons into suites.   Among a range of tectonically significant features, the map also displays major folds, faults, stratigraphic younging directions, interpreted centres of volcanism and locations of U/Pb age determinations, which are numbered and cross-referenced to a table of ages.   This map represents the first attempt internationally to subdivide Archean rock units into Tectonic assemblages, and the first attempt in Ontario to subdivide Paleozic and Mesozoic rock units into depositional sequences.  </em></p>
<p><em>The purpose of this map is to portray the distribution of magmatism and sedimentation in time and space in the rock record of Ontario.  The intended user is a geologist with an academic or applied mineral exploration interest in the components of the bedrock of Ontario that forms the basis of its geochronometric and tectonic record.""</em></p>
<p>This dataset is only available in AutoCAD v.12 DWG and Microstation DGN format.  As such, there are no informative attribute data associated with the features.  However, there are informative map features such as labels, a legend, and a geological time scale which have been incorporated directly into the features.  The tectonic assemblage features and base map features are provided in separate layers.</p>

","<p>The National Hydro Network (NHN), focuses on providing a quality geometric description and a set of basic attributes describing Canada's inland surface waters. It provides geospatial vector data describing hydrographic features such as lakes, reservoirs, rivers, streams, canals, islands, obstacles (e.g. waterfalls, rapids, rocks in water) and constructions (e.g. dams, wharves, dikes), as well as a linear drainage network and the toponymic information (geographical names) associated to hydrography.</p>
<p>The modeling work of the NHN is based in part on Linear referencing System (LRS) concepts. This approach allows the management of geometric representations separately from attribute information (referred to as events in LRS). Unique identifiers (called National Identifiers - NID), associated to each NHN feature, allow for efficient management of updates. The NHN is a vector, topographic data product primarily designed to allow hydrographic network analysis. It is intented for water flow analysis, water and watershed management, environmental and hydrographical applications, as well as for a multitude of cartographic applications.</p>
","<p>For a complete description of NHN product metadata, refer to the record in the <a href=""http://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/a4b190fe-e090-4e6d-881e-b87956c07977"">Open Government Portal</a>.</p>

This product is no longer available for download. If you need access, please contact pmu@ontario.ca indicating the reason why you need this product.
PLEASE EXERCISE CAUTION WHEN USING THIS PRODUCT. THE DATA NO LONGER REPRESENTS THE CURRENT STATE OF OUR WATER RESOURCES.
This Arc Hydro Quaternary Session Data product (referred to this point forward as 'AH product') represents a historical snapshot in time of our base and derived data products. Generally, this product complies with the Version 2.x.x series of our derived hydrology data (DEM, EFDIR, and Waterflow) before August 1, 2009; versions which are no longer supported or updated by SDI. Watercourse and waterbody geometry were largely based on data extracted from LIO in 2007/08 prior to the release of the Ontario Hydro Network (OHN). All these data products have been superseded by our current OHN and Ontario Integrated Hydrology Data (OIHD) products. OIHD is in a format that can directly support data analysis in environments such as Arc Hydro. You will find many similarities between the OIHD and AH products, but OIHD is also open for other uses as well outside of Arc Hydro.
Because the AH product represents an ideal synthesis of our older versioned data, it will continue to be available for future reference and can be used for comparison with our newer products (eg. for change detection purposes). Users may also benefit from the finer raster resolution available in this AH product (10m/20m raster cell size versus our currently supported 30m products) especially in areas where there has been exceptional OBM DTM coverage. However, the user should be aware that this data may no longer reflect the current changes across the landscape. For data currency, please refer to the OIHD product.
The AH product contains the following datasets, which have all been REPLACED by newer products (see their respective metadata for details):
-	'Water Virtual Flow - Seamless Provincial Data Set' &gt;&gt; comparable to the new 'EnhancedWatercourse' component of OIHD
-	 'Waterbody Segment' &gt;&gt; comparable to the current 'OHN Waterbody' dataset
-	 'Enhanced Flow Direction Grid - Provincial' &gt;&gt; comparable to the 'EnhancedFlowDirection' component of OIHD 
The AH product also utilized the currently RETIRED 'Provincial DEM v2.0.0' (Enforced DEM) as a source for all the derived raster products. Because the DEM was not stored within the AH product, you can still access the retired DEM from LIO if you so desire. The limitations of the DEM v2.x.x dataset described in the following document also naturally apply to the AH product as well.
Arc Hydro (AH) is a geospatial and temporal data model for water resources, which operates within ArcGIS and was developed by the GIS in Water Resources (GISWR) Consortium in the United States. The Consortium is comprised of several members including:
- Government agencies - US Geological Survey and the Environmental Protection Agency,
- Academia - Center for Research in Water Resources, University of Texas,
- Professional partners - Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI). 
AH consists of a set of tools used to create and support a comprehensive water resources framework for hydrologic and related geospatial data analysis. The original focus of Arc Hydro was to support surface water modeling, but work has progressed into the groundwater realm. ESRI plans to link the two systems into one complete data modeling framework in the near future.
The Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry - Water Resources Information Program (WRIP) was involved in a multi-year project to develop standardized Arc Hydro surface water data sessions based on the Quaternary Watershed fabric for the Province of Ontario. Each session contains foundation layers required for fundamental hydrologic watershed analysis.
To meet the requirements of Arc Hydro, the project team followed rigorous quality checking and assurance procedures which resulted in extensive and significant base data improvements across the Province. These enhancements are regarded collectively as a 'snapshot' version of our hydrology base and derivative products. Base data updates are happening on a continual basis, which will have implications on any derivative or related product that has been produced to date by the Province. Any further work in Arc Hydro will depend on available resources and support from the various business areas interested in utilizing these data and tools. 
Some key elements of the project include:
- Basic terrain preprocessing developed for each Arc Hydro session populating the Drainage and Network components of the model. 
- Setting up a Regional ID framework to manage Arc Hydro's HydroID at the Provincial level.
- The concepts of Global Delineation and Thresholding explored for complex quaternary sessions and nested watershed scenarios.
- Leveraging the WRIP water flow network in Arc Hydro analysis.
Additional Time Period Information: The base data products were continually QA/QC'ed and updated as the Arc Hydro Project progressed to ensure spatial integrity across all layers and derivative products. Certain areas of the Province were completed at different periods of time since 2006 and have been versioned internally within WRIP. Generally, these AH products comply with Version 2.x.x of our base hydrology products (DEM, EFDIR, and Waterflow) before August 1, 2009.

Four components of the streamflow regime were specifically studied:   frequency, timing, duration and discharge. The resultant baseline hydrology statistics include:
	Information on streamflow regime for each of the WSCs HYDAT stream gauges, and
	A review and summary of the streamflow statistics at the primary watershed scale from the above findings.
The baseline hydrology data product can be used by a wide range of businesses in the Far North. Applications include: land use planning, integrated watershed management, climate change studies and hydropower studies.

In 1968 the Department of Lands and Forests initiated the Aquatic Habitat Inventory Program to collect information for Ontario’s inland water data.  One product was a series of contour maps showing lake depth. In many cases, these maps still represent the only authoritative source of bathymetry data for lakes in Ontario. These maps have been converted to digital GIS data which has resulted in the vast majority of the current data in the Bathymetry Line data class. 
More recent bathymetric data has been collected using sonar and GPS technology. This modern technique creates lake depth points (spot depths) rather than contours. This point data is stored in the Bathymetry Point data class.

The Bathymetry Index contains polygons representing the boundaries of all lakes that have bathymetry populated in the Bathymetry Line data class.  Limited metadata information unique to each lake such as the survey year, survey method and scale of original map is included with the polygons.

In 1968 the Department of Lands and Forests initiated the Aquatic Habitat Inventory Program to collect information for Ontario’s inland water data.  One product was a series of contour maps showing lake depth. In many cases, these maps still represent the only authoritative source of bathymetry data for lakes in Ontario. These maps have been converted to digital GIS data which has resulted in the vast majority of the current data in the Bathymetry Line data class. 
More recent bathymetric data has been collected using sonar and GPS technology. This modern technique creates lake depth points (spot depths) rather than contours. This point data is stored in the Bathymetry Point data class.

Bathymetry Line contains lines of constant depth called depth contours or isobars.  Depth contours are used to describe the terrain relief below the surface of the water.
The data used to derive the depth contours are always spot depths but the density and positional accuracy of these spot depths vary depending on the survey style and parameters. Before GPS data was available, spot depth locations were derived by straight line transects across a water body which were then plotted on a map. The time consuming nature of this method limited the number of transects collected. Now GPS data collection is not limited to transects and therefore spot depth collections tend to be far denser with greater horizontal accuracy.
Depth contours have been derived in one of two ways: 
1. Visually interpreted and drawn by hand based on transects of the water body
2. Interpolated using GIS processes such as Kriging or Natural Neighbours
Vertical accuracy of the data varies greatly depending on the density of spot depth collected for each lake. Horizontal accuracy will also vary greatly on older transect based collections but will be within 5m for GPS based collections.

Bathymetry Points indicate the measurement of water depth at various places in a body of water, and are often called spot depths.
The data in this layer has primarily been collected using a depth measurement device, such as an echo-sounder, in combination with a GPS for horizontal positioning. However, other survey methods such as bathymetric LiDAR may also have been used. Please see the Bathymetry Index layer for the survey method used in each water body.
The points in this layer are the source data for all bathymetric data and should be used (when available) for the creation of bathymetric derivative products such as rasters, TINs and depth contours. Point densities will vary by water body and within water bodies, depending on the parameters or the survey.

Beaches were digitized by Austin Troy from Google Earth (no topology with SOLRIS) in order to support the development of ecological services estimates for the report Estimating Ecosystem Services in Southern Ontario by Spatial Informatics Group, Austin Troy &amp; Ken Bagstad (2009). Two classes of beaches are distinguished, those with infrastructure and those without.

62. Beach near structure (not present in SOLRIS):
 Class description: Open sandy beach along the shore of a great lake, within
approximately 200 meters of a structure.

 Methods: 
1) selected ecodistricts for the case study. 
2)Created a 1 km buffer of those ecodistricts to account for the fact that many of the mapped beaches would be located outside the boundaries of those ecodistricts, which are designed to be at or near the shoreline. 
3) Clipped the region-wide land classification map described in this document to those buffered regions. Hence, some area designated as great lake nearshore was included in the clipped output.
 4)Ecodistricts were exported to Google Earth for overlay.
 5) All beaches were then digitized in Google Earth. Beaches near structures were stored with a different file name prefix than those that were not near structure (the vast majority of beaches fell in the near-structure categoryonly those in designated parks did not). The resulting KML files were imported to ArcGIS as a single geodatabase file.
 6 )A new code was created for each polygon designating whether the polygon was near or not-near a structure.
 7)The resulting polygon layer was then unioned (where all geometry is combined) with the
buffered ecodistricts layer.
 8) The resulting unioned layer was converted to raster, using the beach code as the gridcode. Because of the narrowness of many beaches, the output raster cell size was designated as 7.5 meters, or half the dimensional distance of a SOLRIS pixel.
 9)The clipped classification map (step 3, above), was then updated using the Conditional function in order to recode all pixels that overlaid a beach.

Processing may only be conducted in a provincially licensed slaughter plant or provincially licensed free standing meat plant. The products may only be consumed by the producer and their immediate family on the premises where the animal was slaughtered. Products cannot be sold, shared, donated or distributed.
Certified Examiners may provide stunning, slaughter and dressing services and must perform ante mortem and post mortem examinations. The examiner also ensures humane animal handling and sanitary dressing. Producers may conduct the stunning, slaughter and dressing processes themselves if they wish, under the supervision of a certified examiner.

PLEASE EXERCISE CAUTION WHEN USING THIS PRODUCT. THE DATA NO LONGER REPRESENTS THE CURRENT STATE OF OUR WATER RESOURCES.
The Enhanced Flow Direction Grid  is a collection of related elevation and mapped water features that are used in combination for generating watersheds and to support hydrology applications.
The Enhanced Flow Direction Grid is a grid representing surface flow directions derived from Version 2.0 Digital Elevation Model (DEM) with the added enhancement of having the photogrammetrically mapped hydrology (WRIP Water Virtual Flow and NRVIS water body segment) embedded within the grid so that known hydrology is accurately represented within the grid. 
Also included in version 2 is an alternative assignment of flow direction to shoreline areas. The inclusion has the following effects: Brings the limit of the Flow Direction grid closer to the shoreline resulting in a cleaner product; Allows for the delineation of distinct shoreline catchments not possible in the previous EFD product; Minimizes effects of shoreline bleeding (erroneous catchments being formed in -no-data- areas usually upstream of project areas); and Assigns proper flow directions to minor bays and inlets.
To cover Ontario the grid has been divided  into 16 pieces, existing in their respective UTM zones 15, 16, 17, and 18.   Each grid covers major watersheds within these zones.  The naming conventions of the grid follow the naming conventions of the Secondary and Tertiary Provincial watershed layers.  The resolution of the Enhanced Flow Direction Grid is the same as the Provincial Digital Elevation Model - 10m for southern Ontario (where 1:10,000 base data exists) and 20m for Northern Ontario (where 1:20,000 base data exists).  Currently, 16 of the 16 grids covering Ontario are included in the package.   There are index shapefiles included within the package to show the extent of each grid.

ABOUT THIS RELEASE:

The Far North quaternary boundaries have been created based on ‘Version 2.0’ of the Ontario Integrated Hydrology Data (OIHD) product which will be released in spring, 2015. These boundaries are the first of their kind in the Far North of Ontario.   Previously this area only contained coarse tertiary watershed boundaries created using less accurate federal data. These new watersheds will help support Community Based Land Use Planning (CBLUP) activities in the Far North, and help First Nations communities understand where water is flowing across the landscape in order to better protect natural features of cultural, historical and environmental significance. 

The creation of these boundaries followed newly established watershed principles adopted by International, Federal and Provincial partners involved in globally integrated water resources management. Partnering agencies include the following:
 
•	International Joint Commission (IJC) 
•	Water Survey of Canada (WSC) / Natural Resources Canada (NRCan)
•	Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF)
•	United States Geological Survey (USGS)
•	Other provincial and state-side authorities depending on region of focus. 

This data is considered “Interim” in nature and will eventually be incorporated into a new ‘Version 3’ official update of Ontario’s Provincial Watershed layers. There are several other enhancements planned for these structured datasets, and therefore, a release date has not yet been determined. However, the Far North quaternary packaged product has been produced for the interim to specifically address immediate Far North planning needs at the regional landscape level. The watersheds included in this package cover the entire area draining to the Hudson-James Bay basin within Ontario (excluding the Rainy River basin).

The watershed creation process involved enhanced delineation and smoothing techniques to produce a final product that is consistent with the current regional hydrology available for Ontario. Watershed naming conventions have also been revised to be more closely in line with international naming standards established through the International Watersheds Initiative (IWI) led by IJC. 

A watershed, also known as a catchment basin or area, includes all the land that is drained by a watercourse and its tributaries. A quaternary watershed is a polygon feature that identifies one of the 1000+ subdivisions of the tertiary watershed divisions for all of Ontario. Watersheds created beyond the tertiary level will comply where possible with the USGS area-size criteria. Quaternary watersheds are comparable to the USGS (Hydrologic Unit Coding system) HUC-10 level watershed units in the United States, which have the recommended size range of 40000-250000 acres. A few exceptions apply where the landscape cannot be further subdivided or amalgamated into units which would fit within this acceptable range.

These quaternary divisions were historically developed by the province (dating back to the 1970’s) before the involvement of IJC.  Quaternary divisions were considered an extension of the federal 'Drainage Area' reporting framework originally known as the Water Resources Index Inventory Filing System (WRIIF), which only incorporated tertiary watersheds as the finest level nationally.

The Water Survey of Canada (or, as it was known then, the Department of the Interior, Dominion Water Power Branch) first developed, in 1922, a Water Resources Index Inventory as a convenient and logical system for recording and filing water resources data. It was designed for the storage of such information as the location of waterpower sites, waterpower developments, storage reservoirs, stream measurement stations, and meteorological stations. The Water Survey of Canada delineations involved the division, sub-division and sub-sub-division of Canada into suitably sized areas based on the drainage, for administrative purposes. Although the boundaries are based on drainage, the intent was to include all of Canada's land mass and waters within this drainage area hierarchy to facilitate the identification of hydrometeorological sites. Therefore, the WSC drainage areas do not necessarily define individual river basins, but can represent intervening areas along the coast or include islands.' (National Scale Frameworks HYDROLOGY Version 5.0, NRCan, 2003)

The horizontal positional accuracy of the boundaries is variable depending on the nature and spatial distribution of the raw DEM information, and thus cannot be validated without onsite investigation and verification. In general, southern Ontario is typically within 100m, north-central Ontario ('near north') is within 400m in the Ontario Base Map (OBM) Forestry Area of Undertaking, and the Far North is generally considered within 900m (currently, there is no statistical level of confidence available).
The Far North was derived from 1:50K federal CanVec data, SPOT and Landsat Imagery, and 2000 Shuttle Radar DSM information.",,,"<p><a href=""http://geo.scholarsportal.info/#r/details/_uri@=""5a8b07f0-445a-48d1-aa42-a4b1b0b910b4"">Access this resource</a> on Scholars Geoportal.</p>",Internet,Water Resources, ,,https://www.javacoeapp.lrc.gov.on.ca/geonetwork/srv/en/resources.get.thumbnail?id=14060&access=public&fname=FN_QWS_Thumbnail.png,,,5a8b07f0-445a-48d1-aa42-a4b1b0b910b4,,,,,,,

The Forest Fires Prevention Act, R.S.O, 1994, Sec 21(1) indicates that Inside the Fire Region (IFR) municipalities are responsible to suppress grass, brush or forest fires within their municipal boundaries.

By policy, however, AFFES must ensure that every fire in Ontario receives a response, and every response is governed by:  the predicted behaviour of the fire; the potential impacts on people, property or other values; and the estimated cost of each response. Consequently, OMNR enters into fire management agreements with municipalities in the IFR to ensure that municipal and OMNR responsibilities are met and fires are suppressed in a timely fashion. 

Fire management agreements divide the land into four areas including:
1. Crown Protection Area (CPA): The Crown is responsible for responding to incidents and suppressing of all fires in the CPA.

2. Municipal Protection Area (MPA): The municipality is responsible for responding to incidents and the suppression of all fires in the MPA.

3. Federal Protection Area (FPA): The federal government is responsible for responding to incidents and the suppression of all fires in the FPA.

4. Northern Fire Protection Area (NFPA): The local fire department (mostly in unorganized areas)  is responsible for responding to all incidents and the suppression of fires in the NFPA.

The dataset was based on the concept that Sustainable Forest Licence holders would maintain forest inventory information for lands licenced to them and the Ministry of Natural Resources would maintain the forest inventory information for all other lands. 
Due to the short timeframe and minimal resources for gathering all the information across the province during that period, a limited effort was made to check the attribute values for information supplied by the SFL or information supplied by the MNR. Cursory range checks were made at the time of data load to ensure that attribute entries were valid. At the time of data collection, more effort was placed into ensuring that the forest stand boundaries aligned with the official polygon water layer.
A number of factors lead to improved forest inventory management principles.
In the Autumn of 2006, MNR announced the enhanced Forest Resources Inventory program which included an expanded geographic scope, increased funding scale, a new delivery mechanism, a new governance structure, technological enhancements and revitalized production processes.

It identifies high quality natural cover areas that are 25 hectares or greater within the Lake Simcoe watershed. 
Natural cover includes areas that have been mapped as woodlands (including plantations and hedgerows), wetlands and other rare vegetative cover communities. High quality with respect to natural cover means that the cover demonstrates a number of characteristics that influence the functional ability of a feature such as shape, age, structure and area of cover (LSPP 2009). As stated in the policy, areas of high quality natural cover must be 25 hectares or greater. Natural cover features were merged and internal boundaries dissolved to obtain continuous natural cover polygons before their size was determined. Subsequently, natural cover polygons with an area smaller than 25 ha were excluded. Other patch-based metrics that characterize polygons based on their spatial characteristics and their surrounding matrix were not used to further exclude features because of the uncertainty surrounding their interpretation without referencing information that is not currently available. Ideally, natural cover quality should be evaluated through site level assessment, which would enable determining whether a natural cover feature has structural and compositional characteristics that indicate it serves ecological functions at a higher level when compared to other natural cover features. Given that it is not feasible to perform the required site level evaluations for all natural cover features that are 25 hectares or greater in the watershed, identification, in the near term was restricted to the size criteria only. Natural cover features beyond the Lake Simcoe Protection Act watershed boundary were considered when calculating the total area for continuous natural cover areas. As long as the area is 25 ha or greater and a portion of the area is within the Lake Simcoe watershed it is included in the identified areas of high quality natural cover that are 25 hectares or greater in the watershed.",,,"<p><a href=""http://geo.scholarsportal.info/#r/details/_uri@=""b8a5f778-0c27-4ed0-a2eb-972dd6dc81d1"">Access this resource</a> on Scholars Geoportal.</p>",Internet,Water Resources, ,,,,,b8a5f778-0c27-4ed0-a2eb-972dd6dc81d1,,,,,,,

The historic bathymetry maps were created using simple methods to determine lake depths and were meant for resource management purposes only.  Very little effort was made to identify shoals and other hazards when creating these bathymetric maps. Since the data was collected a number of both constructed and naturally occurring events may have resulted in the depth information becoming inaccurate.  For this reason the historic bathymetric maps should not be used for navigational purposes.

In many cases, these maps still represent the only authoritative source of bathymetry data for lakes in Ontario. These maps are being converted to digital GIS line data which can be found in the Bathymetry Line data class. The Bathymetry Index data class identifies if GIS vector lines have been created.

Only about one percent of Ontario’s lakes contain Lake Trout, but this represents 20-25% of all Lake Trout lakes in the world. The province, therefore, as a great responsibility to manage them wisely. OMNRF efforts to develop a coordinated strategy to protect Lake Trout populations in Ontario requires a comprehensive list of lakes currently designated for Lake Trout management. 
 
This report lists the inland Ontario lakes (exclusive of the Great Lakes) that are currently designated for Lake Trout management. In addition, the list classifies the lakes as to whether they are to be managed for naturally reproducing populations (‘Natural’ lakes) or as put-grow-take (‘P-G-T’) lakes. ‘Natural’ lakes include those lakes that may have lost populations but have been identified for rehabilitation. ‘P-G-T’ lakes are managed to provide recreational fishing opportunities and/or to direct angling effort away from more sensitive ‘Natural’ lakes. OMNRF policies or guidelines may be applied differently depending on the lake classification, or in other cases may be applied to both classifications in a similar manner. 
 
Individual Lake Trout lakes are listed alphabetically in tables organized by OMNRF Administrative Regions. 
 
Most lakes managed for Lake Trout will have been identified previously in other resource management plans. This list supersedes previously published lists and will be subject to revision from time to time, as updated scientific assessment and inventory data become available. Subsequent revisions will be posted on the EBR Registry for public notice and comment. More detailed information on individual lakes may be available from local OMNRF offices.",,,"<p><a href=""http://geo.scholarsportal.info/#r/details/_uri@=""8d020341-f942-4804-b200-bf2d07db2942"">Access this resource</a> on Scholars Geoportal.</p>",Internet,Human Environment, ,,https://www.javacoeapp.lrc.gov.on.ca/geonetwork/srv/en/resources.get.thumbnail?id=14478&access=public&fname=Capture.png,,,8d020341-f942-4804-b200-bf2d07db2942,,,,,,,

The objectives for compiling an inventory of the Lake Simcoe shoreline were to 1) better understand the current state of the shoreline, 2) track changes over time, if the inventory is repeated in the future and 3) assist in identifying priority areas for restoration.

In 2015, the Provincial Geomatics Service Centre (PGSC) in Peterborough updated the shoreline mapping for Lake Simcoe. The shoreline mapping methodology which had been previously used, was revised by reducing the number of shoreline classifications and simplifying the attributes being captured.
 
Orthophoto imagery (2013) was used as the digitizing base, while oblique imagery, taken late fall 2014, was used to assist with shoreline feature interpretation. Attribute fields were added to facilitate change detection analysis with previous shoreline mapping efforts, which had been based on 2008/2009 orthophoto imagery. The shoreline was mapped using a combination of linear shoreline features, shoreline alteration footprints, and offshore features. The eight shoreline classifications were further grouped into a natural, altered, or beach/bar class.

Several partners were involved with the project, including: Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, Environment Canada, Ontario Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change, Severn Sound Environmental Association, Nottawasaga Valley Conservation Authority, Lake Simcoe Region Conservation Authority, and County of Simcoe.

Purpose:  The Lake Simcoe shoreline mapping was updated to fulfill the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry's (MNRF) obligations under the Lake Simcoe Protection Plan to monitor change in natural and altered shoreline.",,,"<p><a href=""http://geo.scholarsportal.info/#r/details/_uri@=""1fcc75a2-ec19-465d-8d24-f9abc1fbf7ab"">Access this resource</a> on Scholars Geoportal.</p>",Internet,Water Resources, ,,,,,1fcc75a2-ec19-465d-8d24-f9abc1fbf7ab,,,,,,,

A withdrawal is an area of Crown Land that has been withdrawn from staking or other use for surface rights, mining rights or both surface and mining rights under various legislative authorities (Mining Act or Public Lands Act). These lands cannot be bought, sold, or transferred.

As per policy 6.30 a technical paper was drafted by the MNR to provide definitions for key natural heritage and key hydrologic features as described in policies 6.21 and 6.22. The key natural heritage feature natural areas abutting Lake Simcoe is defined in this technical paper. The technical paper was completed by June 2, 2010 and was subject to consultation and approval. The technical paper and therefore the definition for natural areas abutting Lake Simcoe was approved March 2015.

Features were mapped based on the definition for natural areas abutting Lake Simcoe. While it is known that key natural heritage feature policies do not apply in settlement areas, these features were mapped for the entire shoreline area outside the Greenbelt Plan area and First Nation lands. 

Mapping of natural areas abutting Lake Simcoe utilized the recently revised MNR mapping of woodlands and wetlands for the Lake Simcoe watershed. Methodology used by Aurora and Midhurst MNR districts for the Southern Ontario Land Resource Information System (SOLRIS) Phase 1 project was applied to update the woodland, evaluated wetlands and identified wetlands layers utilizing orthophotography acquired in the spring of 2008.

Natural areas abutting Lake Simcoe Definition:
Natural Areas Abutting Lake Simcoe means land that extends from the Lake Simcoe shoreline with natural self sustaining vegetation of any plant form or potential natural community. 

Notwithstanding the above, natural areas abutting Lake Simcoe do not include vegetation communities maintained by anthropogenic-based disturbances (e.g. land for agricultural uses, manicured lawns or ornamental plantings).

Feature Identification 
Natural areas abutting Lake Simcoe are areas of a continuous vegetation community class that have a minimum size of 1 ha and are wholly or partially within the 30 m buffer zone of the Lake Simcoe shoreline. These areas may be a narrow band of vegetation along the shoreline or larger areas, which extend a greater distance from the shoreline. As described in policy 6.31-SA, the MNR and the MOE will map the location of natural areas abutting Lake Simcoe.

For purposes of identifying natural areas abutting Lake Simcoe, vegetation communities separated by an opening of &gt;10 m would be considered separate features. A bisecting opening &lt;10 m wide would not be considered to separate a natural area abutting Lake Simcoe into two features. However, the developed portion (e.g., public road or active rail line) of any bisecting opening will not be included in the calculation of area for natural areas abutting Lake Simcoe.",,,"<p><a href=""http://geo.scholarsportal.info/#r/details/_uri@=""9543a6eb-2b65-451e-80d8-ffc96ba682f2"">Access this resource</a> on Scholars Geoportal.</p>",Internet,Water Resources, ,,,,,9543a6eb-2b65-451e-80d8-ffc96ba682f2,,,,,,,

The goal of the project was to use industry standard, scientifically-defensible protocols to inventory all of the natural areas in the community. The resulting data and map provides a representation of the natural cover and features of the Niagara watershed using the Ecological Land Classification (ELC), a standard in Ontario to classify natural areas.</p><p>Those who have spent time in the natural areas in and around Niagara know that this part of the province, with its Carolinian heritage and proximity to the Great Lakes, is a treasure trove of natural wonders. These areas support a rich diversity of natural features including rare plants and animals, significant habitats and geological formations, and important wildlife corridors. A comprehensive biological inventory to document the vegetative communities of our watershed and their inhabitants has never been completed. As data was collected, the project built on existing information ultimately confirming the significance of known sites and filling information gaps. The result is a solid resource of information, which includes accurate natural heritage mapping, a list of local rarity, and site specific species information that will be of tremendous benefit to all watershed residents.The data collected through the project has helped to foster the development of greater environmental awareness within the community, prioritize restoration opportunities and, will serve as baseline for planning decisions and policy development.</p>",,,"<p><a href=""http://geo.scholarsportal.info/#r/details/_uri@=""3721947560"">Access this resource</a> on Scholars Geoportal.</p>",Internet,Physical Environment,Ontario,vector,http://images.scholarsportal.info/gis/thumbnails/OCUL/OCUL_NPCA_200609_NAI.png,,,3721947560,,,,,,,

These map tiles were based on the UTM Nad27 (May 76) coordinate system but have been transformed to NAD83 for storage. 

The tiles come in two sizes: 
• 10000m by 10000m for 1:20,000 and 
• 5000m by 5000m for 1:10,000

These map tiles are oriented according to UTM coordinates and the map identifier references the lower left corner. 
The mapsheet identifier is a 13 digit number in the following format: SSZZEEEENNNNN 
• SS represents scale (10 = 1:10,000 and 20 = 1:20,000) 
• ZZ represents the UTM zone number (15, 16, 17, 18) 
• EEEE are the first 4 digits of the UTM easting 
• NNNNN are the first 5 digits of the UTM northing 
Eg. 2015650054500 -1:20,000 scale map (10000m x 10000m) in UTM zone 15 with the lower left at (650000,5450000) 

Maps on the UTM zone boundary will be trimmed by the UTM zone boundary. 


NOTE: Because of the transformation from NAD27 to NAD83 coordinate systems, the location of the index tiles will appear to be shifted.
The following two layers are Nad83 and can be used in place of the OBM_Index for current cartographic applications:

It allows the user to view select hydrology information such as stream flow statistics. OFAT calculates flow quantity estimation values and several intermediate outputs, such as watershed delineation and characterization. These derivatives can be used by a variety of users and applied to many water-related applications.
Using a base map for reference, the OFAT user defines a watershed drainage point on a mapped hydrology feature such as a stream, river, or lake anywhere within the land boundary of Ontario, including Ontario’s Far North. The resulting watershed polygon can then be used within OFAT to summarize key watershed characteristics. The watershed boundary and characteristics are used in Flood Flow, Low Flow, and Mean Annual Flow models.
The user can view all spatial and tabular outputs online and download the outputs for further specialized viewing or analysis.

Land Classification as used by the Ontario Land Inventory (OLI) is a system of describing the physical features of the land which exert the most significant influence upon the growth of the plant community.
The Timber Use Capability ratings of the OLI indicate the potential ability of land to grow tree crops.  These ratings are specifically related to the physical features which control the rate of tree growth.
Wildlife Use Capability indicates the natural ability of the land to provide the required habitat for a given species.  The selection of wildlife species for which an area is rated, is based on the natural range of each species.
Recreation Use Capability classifies the land for its inherent ability to attract and sustain recreation use.  The physical features of the land determine the intensity of use that can be attracted and sustained.  A recreation feature that can attract and sustain use by many people rates higher than a feature that can only attract and sustain a few.
The Shoreland Recreation information describes the physical features of the wet beach and backshore of a lake and rates the sites for their capability for bathing and camping activities and lodging and deep water activities.
Originally produced as published maps  only the Land Classification, Wildlife and Timber information are currently avaliable in a digital format.

The ORDSM was generated using data sourced from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), which collected Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (IfSAR). The Space Shuttle Endeavor mission performed a single pass radar interferometry from two antennae mounted 60 m apart with a swath width of 225 km. Orbiting the Earth 176 times during the 11 day mission, the SRTM successfully captured radar data for over 80% of the Earth’s land surface. A more detailed description of the SRTM mission, including publically available data, can be found here -  (https://lta.cr.usgs.gov/SRTM1Arc). 
The horizontal extent of the Ontario Radar DSM provides continuous spatial coverage between the southern-most extent of the province (41 degrees latitude) and north to 57 degrees latitude. 
The horizontal coordinate system of the Ontario Radar DSM is converted from a Geographic Coordinate System to MNRF Lambert Conformal Conic projection. The horizontal datum of the Ontario Radar DSM is North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83).  
The elevation vertical datum of the Ontario Radar DSM is based on two different systems: 
•	Canadian Geodetic Vertical Datum 1928 (CGVD28), which is the current national and provincial elevation data standard. GRS80 for NAD83 is used as the reference ellipsoid.
•	Earth Gravitational Model 1996 (EGM96), which is used by the source data. WGS84 reference ellipsoid is used.
The Ontario Radar DSM has been interpolated at a consistent linear spatial resolution and geospatial coordinate system similar to other MNRF elevation products, which allows for seamless integration.
 Elevations are orthometric and expressed in reference to Mean Sea Level (MSL).  
Units of measures are in meters.",,,"<p><a href=""http://geo.scholarsportal.info/#r/details/_uri@=""afd406c4-8e9b-4511-827a-ba16628e4b0f"">Access this resource</a> on Scholars Geoportal.</p>",Internet,Topography, ,,https://www.javacoeapp.lrc.gov.on.ca/geonetwork/srv/en/resources.get.thumbnail?id=13239&access=public&fname=Ontario_4_metadata_l.png,,,afd406c4-8e9b-4511-827a-ba16628e4b0f,,,,,,,

In 2009, the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF), along with other Canadian Provincial counterparts were invited to participate in a Natural Resources Canada (NRCAN) initiative to define the National Railway Network (NRWN) to be stored and maintained in GeoGratis. The project’s goal was to define a national standard for railway network spatial and attribute information.
The NRWN project involved extensive consultation with information owners of railway geospatial datasets from both Private and Public sectors. At the same time, the MNRF’s Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) program re-examined the business needs for their own LIO railway-themed information. As crucial internal business requirements were reflected in the proposed NRWN data standards, SDI launched a project to adapt these into LIO Warehouse Database versions of the NRWN geospatial layers.

This most recent glaciation has played a major role in shaping and creating the physical landscape of Ontario. The deposits and effects of these glaciations are widespread with till being the most common deposit left by the Laurentide Ice Sheet. Three main end members of till were produced, sandy tills from the erosion of Precambrian rocks; silty tills derived from the erosion of carbonate rocks and clayey tills deposited in front of the glacier in local or regional area of ponding. Considerable volumes of melt water were generated by, and discharged from, the glaciers that once occupied Ontario. Large amounts of glacial debris were transported by the meltwater and deposited as stratified sediments under the glacier and along the ice margin (glaciofluvial ice-contact deposits), and beyond the ice margin in rivers and streams (glaciofluvial outwash deposits), lakes (glaciolacustrine and lucustrine deposits) and seas (glaciomarine and marine deposits).</p> <p>The Quaternary Geology Data Set is a digital interpretation of this Surficial Geology for the Province of Ontario, illustrating the general distribution of the various types of Quaternary sediments and the major landforms associated with them.

The database consolidated the existing digital soil data mapped on a county basis into a digitally stitched and standardized product. 

The soil survey data was mapped by a number of soil surveyors from the 1920s to the 1990s. The Soil Ontario product incoporates soil information from a variety of map scales. The project has brought the individual county or regional municipality surveys together in a digitally stitched database which reveals inconsistencies in soil data across county boundaries. Using GIS and NRVIS (Natural Resource Values Information System) a GIS Specialist matched the soil polygons that crossed boundaries using the best available resources.

An Element Occurrence (EO) is an area of land and/or water in which a species or natural community is, or was, present. An EO should have practical conservation value for the Element as evidenced by potential continued (or historical) presence and/or regular recurrence at a given location.</p><p>For species Elements, the EO often corresponds with the local population, but when appropriate may be a portion of a population or a group of nearby populations (e.g., metapopulation). For community Elements, the EO may represent a stand or patch of a natural community, or a cluster of stands or patches of a natural community. Because they are defined on the basis of biological information, EOs may cross jurisdictional boundaries. An Element Occurrence record is a data management tool that has both spatial and tabular components including a mappable feature and its supporting database. EOs are typically represented by bounded, mapped areas of land and/or water or, at small scales, the centroid point of this area. EO records are most commonly created for current or historically known occurrences of natural communities or native species of conservation interest.

As part of the LHIN's mandate, there is often a need to analyse and present information at finer scales. As a result, all LHINs have defined smaller geographic areas within their boundaries. Although the naming convention varies between LHINs, in this product these regions are referred to as ""SubLHIN planning areas"" or, more compactly, as ""subLHINs"".</p> <p>The external boundaries of the province's LHINs are embedded in legislation and have remained stable since 2006. In contrast, subLHINs are defined by the individual LHINs for their own analytical and planning purposes. SubLHIN geographic definitions vary substantially between LHINs and are subject to change because of the needs of indivdual LHINs.</p> <p>In 2007, subLHIN boundaries were assembled for the province by the Health System Intelligence Project (HSIP) from definitions provided by the LHINs. In April, 2008, with the cessation of HSIP, the Health Analytics Branch (HAB) of the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care took over the maintenance of the provincial subLHIN boundary file. Updates to the subLHIN boundaries were passive and new versions of the boundary file were created only when a LHIN approached HAB with new geographic definitions. Beginning with Version 9.0 of the subLHIN boundaries, the MOHLTC consulted all LHINs to design and establish each LHINs planning areas.</p> <p>Version 9.0 reflects substantial change in the subLHIN boundaries compared to version 8.0.

The Wetland data class provides a spatial representation and attribute information for wetlands in Ontario.
 
Not all wetlands have been identified and mapped. Active maintenance is ongoing throughout the province. The currency and accuracy of the spatial representation is variable and requires on-the-ground verification.

Many attribute fields were added in 2012. Values will be added to these fields over time. Refer to the Wetland User Guide for details on using the data.
 
Certain attributes identify which wetlands have been evaluated with the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES) and of those which ones have been designated as Provincially Significant wetlands (PSW). 

Previous to 2011 this data class contained only Evaluated Wetland data. In the spring of 2011 through the Wetland Consolidation project business areas were consulted to identify the best available existing MNR wetland data for each MNR district. The resulting data were added to this data class where it did not overlap existing Evaluated Wetland data. Sources for wetland data included Wetland Interim (OBM/NTS), Forest Resource Inventory (FRI), Southern Ontario Land 
Recourse Inventory System (SOLRIS) and MNRF district data. 

Wetlands are lands that are seasonally or permanently flooded by shallow water as well as lands where the water table is close to the surface; in either case the presence of abundant water causes the formation of hydric (moist) soils and has favoured the dominance of either hydrophytic (water loving) or water tolerant plants. 

An individual spatial polygon represents a discrete wetland type. Values for wetland types are marsh, fen, swamp, bog, treed peatland, open water or unknown. Evaluated Wetlands are those identified and assessed using the technical criteria in the OWES manuals. An evaluation may be for either an Evaluated Wetland or an Evaluated Wetland Complex. Not all wetlands in Ontario have been evaluated. An Evaluated Wetland consists of one or more adjacent (contiguous) wetland polygons. An Evaluated Wetland Complex is a group of separated wetland polygons that have similar or complementary biological, social and/or hydrological functions, are located in close proximity, and are functionally linked (ecologically or hydrologically). An Evaluated Wetland Complex may contain adjacent wetland polygons but must comprise at least one separated wetland polygon. Wetlands that meet certain criteria through OWES are designated as PSWs. 

The wetland polygons are managed independently from other hydro data classes and may overlap waterbodies or other hydro data. 

Due to the changing landscape in the south western portion of the province and the vintage of available source data, MNRF Aylmer district chose not to add some of the unevaluated wetland data from other sources to the existing Wetland Unit layer during the Wetland Consolidation Project of 2011. The Far North Hudson Bay Lowlands and surrounding area have been updated as of March 31 2013. 

Legislated or Legal Authority for Collection: The OWES evaluation information is collected to support the wetlands component of the Provincial Policy Statement. OWES data collection began in the early 1980's and will be on-going. Wetland evaluations are subject to changes as more information becomes available. 

Not all of the OWES information is stored in this layer. The complete OWES file including supporting material and field notes is kept at the MNR district office. Depending on any sensitivity or security issues associated with this information holding, some of the information may not be available for viewing or distribution.",,,"<p><a href=""http://geo.scholarsportal.info/#r/details/_uri@=""04e466a9-7731-438c-a37a-38fde98202b7"">Access this resource</a> on Scholars Geoportal.</p>",Internet,Water Resources, ,,https://www.javacoeapp.lrc.gov.on.ca/geonetwork/srv/en/resources.get.thumbnail?id=77&access=public&fname=WETLAND.png,,,04e466a9-7731-438c-a37a-38fde98202b7,,,,,,,

Imagery acquired over 3 periods (2000, 2006 and 2011) will be used to generate Change Detection Data Sets which will detail the nature and extent of each change event. This data, along with a complete mapping of rural land use will be incorporated into a new release of SOLRIS current to 2011.  The Change Detection Data Sets can also be used to update finer scale feature mapping such as the Land Information Ontario Wooded Area or Wetland databases. 
The Change Detection Data Sets are scheduled for completion at the end of March 2013. SOLRIS 2011 is scheduled for release at the end of March 2014.",,,"<p><a href=""http://geo.scholarsportal.info/#r/details/_uri@=""bf4edf9f-054e-4a92-89d0-f4c75e3bffa9"">Access this resource</a> on Scholars Geoportal.</p>",Internet,Boundaries, ,,https://www.javacoeapp.lrc.gov.on.ca/geonetwork/srv/en/resources.get.thumbnail?id=676&access=public&fname=WOODAREA.png,,,bf4edf9f-054e-4a92-89d0-f4c75e3bffa9,,,,,,,

This geospatial dataset provides the location of Family Health Team locations in Ontario.  

Family Health Teams (FHT) are community-centred primary care organizations whose programs and services are geared to the population groups they serve. FHTs provide primary care services to rural, urban, and unique populations of patients with both typical and specialized health needs. They include a team of family physicians, nurse practitioners, registered nurses, social workers, dietitians, and other professionals who work together to provide primary health care for their community. FHTs were created to expand access to comprehensive family health care services across Ontario.

This dataset includes the FHT’s main office locations as well as the practice locations of the family physicians affiliated with the Family Health Teams. A physician can practice at more than one location however only their primary address is included in this dataset.

Note: It is possible that a FHT’s main office has no practicing physicians at that location.",,,"<p><a href=""http://geo.scholarsportal.info/#r/details/_uri@=""ca4a97d3-a996-4974-af23-8b2bce02ee28"">Access this resource</a> on Scholars Geoportal.</p>",Internet,Location, ,,,,,ca4a97d3-a996-4974-af23-8b2bce02ee28,,,,,,,

The OTN contains networks in urban, rural and wilderness settings managed by a named organization for recreation, active living or tourism purposes. Examples of trails in the OTN include; Hiking, Running and Walking trails; Cycling and Mountain Bike routes; All Terrain Vehicle, Snowmobiling and Dirt Bike trails; X-Country Skiing and Snow shoeing trails; Equestrian trails; and Canoe and Portage Routes.
OTN Trail Segment contains trail segments that define a linear corridor through the natural or urban environment. These corridors may be single segments or form a looping system. One trail segment is distinguished from another trail segment within the same trail by having different features. Linking the OTN Segment to the OTN Trailhead, trail segments are further defined by the characteristics of a trail, e.g. trail name, length etc. 
The OTN project is the combined efforts of trail organizations and three levels of government (Federal, Provincial and Municipal) working to create a common and shared trail infrastructure which is composed trails and their descriptive attributes across the whole of the province.",,,"<p><a href=""http://geo.scholarsportal.info/#r/details/_uri@=""de585e6f-ff96-4737-99af-ac26064bf3e2"">Access this resource</a> on Scholars Geoportal.</p>",Internet,Human Environment, ,,https://www.javacoeapp.lrc.gov.on.ca/geonetwork/srv/en/resources.get.thumbnail?id=912&access=public&fname=OTNtrailseg.png,,,de585e6f-ff96-4737-99af-ac26064bf3e2,,,,,,,

This geospatial dataset provides the locations of Community Care Access Centres (CCACs) in Ontario.  CCACs are the local organizations established by the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care to provide access to government-funded home and community services and long-term care homes. CCACs work together, and with physicians, hospital teams, and other health care providers to enhance access and co-ordination for people who need care in the community. They help people to live independently at home and apply for admission to a long-term care home.  CCACs also provide information about local community support service agencies and can link people to these agencies to arrange services.

It also indicates the availability of digital inventories from the Land Information Ontario Warehouse (LIOW) as structured (Forest Cover data class) and packaged (zip file) products through the Land Information Data Subscription (LIDS) service.
----------
It is important to note that forest inventories are differentiated by the following two versions or products: 
1) Forest Resources Inventory (FRI): 
This is the initial or first new data capture version of the forest resource inventory for a unit that is delivered to OMNR Districts and Sustainable Forest Licence (SFL) holders. In most cases, it involves the complete re-inventory of the forested land within a unit. It provides a basis for planning inventories described below.
---
2) Planning Composite Inventory (PCI):
Once delivered, the FRI (1) is updated by OMNR Districts and Forest Companies for Forest Management Planning purposes. Spatial and attribute data are updated on an as-required or scheduled basis to reflect changes to the forest landscape (e.g. natural disturbances, harvesting and regeneration). The planning inventory contains additional attributes and information that conform to Forest Information Manual (FIM) standards to support the forest management planning process.
----------
Note: The majority of FRI unit boundaries represented in this layer reflects, and are kept current to the latest version of the Forest Management Unit boundary layer.
----------
For additional information, refer to the NRVIS User Guide for this layer that is available for download on the Land Information Ontario (LIO) website Data in the Warehouse page.
Legislated or Legal Authority for Collection: Supports the Forest Information Manual (FIM) and provides various MNR business areas with fundamental forest inventory information needed to met their program mandates.
Additional Time Period Information: Information regarding the availability of FRI Products will be kept current in this layer as they are made available.
Additional Metadata Location: User Guide for this layer can be downloaded from the LIO Data in the Warehouse page

The OTN contains networks in urban, rural and wilderness settings managed by a named organization for recreation, active living or tourism purposes. Examples of trails in the OTN include; Hiking, Running and Walking trails; Cycling and Mountain Bike routes; All Terrain Vehicle, Snowmobiling and Dirt Bike trails; X-Country Skiing and Snow shoeing trails; Equestrian trails; and Canoe and portage routes.
OTN Trailhead contains trailhead points which describe the characteristics of a trail such as trail name, length, type, permitted use, amenity, and organization. 
OTN Trailhead contains points that represent the location of the start of the trail as well as secondary access points.  A trailhead exists for each trail and may consist of one or more trail segments. By linking the OTN Trailhead to OTN Trail Segment, the linear corridor/linear segment of the trail can be linked to the trailhead.
The OTN project is the combined efforts of trail organizations and three levels of government (Federal, Provincial and Municipal) working to create a common and shared trail infrastructure which is composed trails and their descriptive attributes across the whole of the province.",,,"<p><a href=""http://geo.scholarsportal.info/#r/details/_uri@=""ce2148e6-a4c3-48b6-a734-82729f6ff3db"">Access this resource</a> on Scholars Geoportal.</p>",Internet,Human Environment, ,,https://www.javacoeapp.lrc.gov.on.ca/geonetwork/srv/en/resources.get.thumbnail?id=913&access=public&fname=OTNTHD.png,,,ce2148e6-a4c3-48b6-a734-82729f6ff3db,,,,,,,
