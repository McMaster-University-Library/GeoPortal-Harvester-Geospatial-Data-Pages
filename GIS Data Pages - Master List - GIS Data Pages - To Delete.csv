The Multiple Enhanced Postal Code product allows for a one to many relationship. For example, one postal code may represent more than one postal code location. This dataset is provided as one point file covering all of Canada. The FSA boundaries represent the first three characters of a postal code. FSA boundaries are relatively large, so this dataset is provided as one polygon file covering all of Canada. The LDU boundaries represent the geographic location of the 6 digit postal code. LDUs are relatively large and very numerous, so a separate shapefile is provided for each province.</p>
<p>Other attributes associated with this dataset include: Points of Call (number of points serviced by the postal code) for apartments, businesses, houses, farms, and in total; birth date and (when applicable) date of retirement; and dominant delivery mode (direct, lock box, rural route etc.).</p>
<p>To complement this dataset, DMTI also provides a ""Postal2Census"" translation table, which can be used to join MEPs to various levels of census geography.  This table is included with the 2006-2008 datasets, but is provided separately (and therefore, but be specifically requested) for the 2009 dataset onwards.  More information about this table can be viewed on the <a href=""http://library.mcmaster.ca/maps/geospatial/postal2census-translation-table"">library's website</a>.</p>

","<p>The inventory for recreational landuse capability has 7 Classes, from Class 1 with high capability to Class 7 with very low capability. The classification also examines the quantity of recreational use that a land unit can attract and withstand without permanent damage to the natural landscape.</p>

<p>This table was specifically created to complement the DMTI product ""Platinum Postal Suite"".  More information about Platinum Postal Suite can be found on the <a href=""http://library.mcmaster.ca/maps/geospatial/platinum-postal-suite-0"">library's website</a> .  This table can be joined to the MEP point file provided in Platinum Postal Suite using the ""MEP_ID"" field.  The point file and the table must be of the same version in order to join correctly.</p>
<p>Please note that this table is extremely large, containing over 1.3 million records.  It will often cause ArcMap to crash if handled incorrectly.  It is prudent to first determine which MEPs are of interest to you, using the MEP file from Platinum Postal Suite, then selecting those records out of the table and working with the subset.</p>

<p>SOLRIS was initially developed by the MNR's Science and Information Branch (SIB) in partnership with Ducks Unlimited, but ultimately involved partnership with several other agencies.  The final version of SOLRIS (v1.2) is made available through the Ontario Geographic Data Exchange (OGDE) as part of the Land Information Ontario (LIO) data warehouse.</p>
<p>SOLRIS was created by intergrating geospatial databases of forests and wetlands with topographic maps, aerial photos and satellite imagery for seamless coverage of Ecoregions 6E and 7E.  The resulting inventory divides the Southern Ontario landscape according to the Ecological Land Classification (ELC) described in Lee et al<em>.</em>, 1998.  These classifications include: Open Cliff and Talus, Alvar, Shoreline, Open Shoreline, Sand Barren and Dune (Open and Treed),  Open Tallgrass Prairie, Tallgrass Savannah, Tallgrass Woodland, Forest, Coniferous Forest, Mixed Forest, Deciduous Forest, Plantations, Hedgerows, Transportation, Extraction, Built-up Area (Pervious and Impervious), Swamp, Fen, Bog, Marsh, and Open Water. Please note that there are large tracts of land which are classified as ""Undifferentiated"".</p>
<p>Two versions are available.  Version 1.1 covers a smaller geographic extent (primarily the Golden Horsehoe area), but has much less area classified as undifferentiated.  Version 1.2 is the ""final"" version, with full coverage of southern Ontario.  Data are available in ESRI GRID raster format and ESRI shapefile vector format in both versions.</p>

","JPG2000 (.jp2), GeoTIFF",McMaster Students / Staff / Faculty only,,"<p>SPOT 4/5 imagery was acquired and orthorectified for the entire country by Natural Resources Canada (NRCAN) within a National SPOT orthoimage project between May 2005 and October 2010. The province of Ontario was a partner in this project.</p>
<p>The original imagery was acquired and processed to have a ground sample distance (GSD or pixel spacing) of 10 metres for a panchromatic band and 20 metres for three multispectral bands. MNR has pan-sharpened and enhanced the images covering Ontario, to form a set of 10 metre multispectral (infra-red, red and green) images. This set of images is available as geo-referenced TIFF and/or JPEG2000 files.</p>
<p>Each band has a radiometry of 8 bits (values between 0 and 255). The multispectral image provides four bands. The minimum cloud-free (2% maximum) coverage required for an image (selected zone) is 40 km x 40 km, panchromatic and multispectral taken simultaneously.</p>
<p>Spatial data is expressed according to Universal Transverse Mercator projection, in reference to the North American Datum 1983 - Canadian Spatial Reference System (NAD83CSRS).</p>
<p>Note that these are individual, overlapping images and do not form a mosaic. A subset of these images covering the Far North of Ontario have been processed into a mosaic.

</ul>
","<p>A watershed, also known as a catchment basin or area, includes all of the land that is drained by a watercourse and its tributaries. </p>
<p>Watersheds are used in many types of landscape analysis. They are the fundamental unit in which we can understand water in our landscape, including water quantity (flows, levels, etc) and quality (contamination, source protection, etc).</p>
<p>These boundaries have been created based on the recent Version 2 Provincial DEM and Enhanced Flow Direction products released 2006-2008. The generation of the boundaries also involved some enhanced interpolation and smoothing techniques to produce a final product that is consistent with the current regional hydrology available for Ontario. Watershed naming conventions have also been revised to be more closely in line with Federal names where appropriate down to the tertiary watershed level. Names are currently not available at the quaternary level but can be identified by a watershed code.</p>

8351,FAO Map of World Soil Resources,2003,"<p>United Nations. Food and Agriculture Administration (FAO)</p>
",Shapefile,McMaster Students / Staff / Faculty only,,"<p>This product contains information on world soil resources across all major continents broken down into soil units of various soil classifications. </p>
<p>From the metadata description:</p>
<p>In 1990 a Map of World Soil Resources was completed at scale 1:25 000 000, generalized from the FAO/UNESCO Soil Map or the World at scale 1: 5 000 000 (FAO, 1971 – 1981).<br />
The map was issued on the occasion of the 14th International Congress of Soil Science held in Kyoto, Japan in 1990. Since then new material has become available, the FAO/UNESCO Soil Map of the World has been partly updated under the SOTER Programme and the FAO legend has been replaced by the World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB).  In 1998 the latter was adopted by the International Union of Soil Sciences as the standard for soil correlation and nomenclature. In the light of these new developments it was decided to prepare an updated version of the generalized Map of the World Soil Resources at 1: 25 000 000.</p>
<p>The updating exercise covered:</p>
<p>-        the switch from the original map projection to a Flat Polar Arctic Quartic projection.<br />
-        the conversion of the FAO legend into the WRB classification.<br />
-        the incorporation of additional soil data obtained from new or revised soil map sources.<br />
-        the matching , when possible of soil unit boundaries with major landforms. <br />

8948,Land and Water Digital Map Series 33: Soil and Terrain database for Central Africa,2006,"<p>United Nations. Food and Agricultural Administration (FAO)</p>
",Shapefile (.shp),McMaster Students / Staff / Faculty only,,"<p>The FAO-Unesco Soil Map of the World is the only existing globally consistent soil resources information for the Central African region. This Soil Map of the World does not reflect the present state of knowledge as new soil inventories were done after its publication. Therefore, ISRIC was contracted by FAO to create a SOTER database for Central Africa from all existing information. The project includes the compilation of a soil and terrain database for Burundi and Rwanda (1:1 million scale) and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (1:2 million scale).</p>
<p>The materials and methods that have been used include the Space Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission digital elevation model, generating the physiography of the area, existing geological and soil maps and soil profile information.</p>
<p>Democratic Republic of the Congo - Detailed Information:</p>
<p>The database of the DR of Congo is defined by pre-independence soil information at low-resolution, enhanced with landform information derived from DEM data and lithological information derived from the geological map. Reconnaissance, semi-detailed and detailed soil maps, covering about 15% of the country, were consulted to improve the delineation of the SOTER unites and to characterize the soil components. A total of 144 SOTER units have been identified.</p>
<p>Rwand and Burundi - Detailed Information:</p>
<p>The SOTER databases of Rwanda and Burundi are based on generalization of relatively recent medium resolution 1:250,000 soil maps. Burundi has 56 SOTER units, Rwanda has 41.</p>
<p>Folder also includes SOTERCAF Report 2006/7, SOTERCAF Readme File, and SOTERCAF MS Access Database.</p>

This data consists of orthorectified image derivatives from the Level Basic-1B bundled imagery provided to the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources (OMNR) by Digital Globe, Inc. Pansharpened images (60 - 70 cm true colour composites) are required for mapping applications that require high-resolution background imagery. Additional image derivatives, such as enhanced Multispectral and Greyscale (Panchromatic) products (GeoTIFF and MrSID formats) may also be generated depending on requirements. Raw (Basic-1B) imagery was secured from Digital Globe to ensure that the orthorectification process could be conducted under the supervision of OMNR staff, with an adherence to the geospatial standards of the Natural Resources Values Information System (NRVIS).</p>
