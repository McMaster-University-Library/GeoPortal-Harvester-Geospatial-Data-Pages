# Scholars GeoPortal API Harvesting

This repository is a resource to create Google-indexed static web pages for all data layers that are available to McMaster users in the Scholars GeoPortal, to improve discoverability.

## Resource: Content.xml



## Tool: Harvester.py

Using Python 3.5, content from Scholars GeoPortal in XML file format is parsed and selected data fields are written to an output CSV file. These fields currently include for each item in the GeoPortal, its identifier, title, producer, abstract, range of years of available publications, GeoPortal permalink, and a link to the item's thumbnail image.
