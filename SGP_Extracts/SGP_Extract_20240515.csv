ALIS delineates streams based on a number of different natural features. This application has been applied on the Ontario side of the Great Lakes to identify continuous valley segments and has been used to attribute landscape attributes for sites where fish and habitat data are available.</p><p>The ALIS database is made up of two components: an application and a data component. The GIS application will offer users a tool to extract data, summarize and report results and classify, categorize, etc. the data collected through ALIS. The second component is strictly a Microsoft Access 2002 database containing the data. The GIS application component links to the data component, this allows for central control over the master attribute data. In order to run ALIS, the user must be running a licensed version of ArcGIS 8.1. or later. In addition, the user will also need a copy of Microsoft Access 2002 to store the data. Once the data has been collected, users with a copy of Microsoft Access 2000 will be able to work with the attribute data stored in the ALIS database independent of the GIS application.</p>",2001 - 2003,"<p><a href=""http://geo.scholarsportal.info/#r/details/_uri@=2778258636"">Access this resource</a> on Scholars Geoportal.</p>",http://images.scholarsportal.info/gis/thumbnails/OGDE/OGDE_ALIS.png,Various geospatial formats available.,McMaster Students / Staff / Faculty only.

It was originally designed in 1946 to locate merchantable timber species for supplying mills.</p> <p> The FRI was designed as a large-scale survey that would allow general characterization of the forest in terms of species, forest conditions and regeneration. Traditionally, the FRI has been based on aerial photo interpretation, as well as some field surveys.</p> <p>A Forest Management Unit (FMU) is a designated administrative area that depicts a forest management boundary. The area within these boundaries are used for forest resource planning and management purposes of the Crown Forest Sustainability Act. An FMU is primarily identified by an assigned official name and a unique numeric code.</p> <p>Forest inventories are differentiated by the following two versions or products: </br> 1) Forest Resources Inventory (FRI): This is the initial or first new data capture version of the forest resource inventory for a unit that is delivered to OMNR Districts and Sustainable Forest Licence (SFL) holders. In most cases, it involves the complete re-inventory of the forested land within a unit. It provides a basis for planning inventories described below. </br> </br> 2) Planning Composite Inventory (PCI): Once delivered, the FRI (1) is updated by OMNR Districts and Forest Companies for Forest Management Planning purposes. Spatial and attribute data are updated on an as-required or scheduled basis to reflect changes to the forest landscape (e.g. natural disturbances, harvesting and regeneration). The planning inventory contains additional attributes and information that conform to Forest Information Manual (FIM) standards to support the forest management planning process.</p>",2011,"<p><a href=""http://geo.scholarsportal.info/#r/details/_uri@=91887968"">Access this resource</a> on Scholars Geoportal.</p>",http://images.scholarsportal.info/gis/thumbnails/OGDE/OGDE_FORESTAT_tablejoin.png,Various geospatial formats available.,McMaster Students / Staff / Faculty only.

The Water Survey of Canada delineations involved the division, sub-division and sub-sub-division of Canada into suitably sized areas based on the drainage, for administrative purposes. Although the boundaries are based on drainage, the intent was to include all of Canada's land mass and waters within this drainage area hierarchy to facilitate the identification of hydrometeorological sites. Therefore, the WSC drainage areas do not necessarily define individual river basins, but can represent intervening areas along the coast or include islands.'

Based on differences in age, metamorphism and tectonic setting, the Precambrian rocks are subdivided into the Superior, Southern and Grenville provinces. The Phanerozoic rocks occur in four basins. Major faults and shear zones are also included. The legend is subdivided geochronologically in the Phanerozoic, but geochronometrically in the Proterozoic and Archean. The Archean rocks of the Superior Province are subdivided into lithologic units. Supracrustal units of the Southern Province and the Phanerozoic Eon are subdivided lithostratigraphically. The Grenville Province is subdivided into major tectonic blocks and within each block the legend is mainly lithologic, with only part of the supracrustal rock record subdivided into lithostratigraphic units.

The original focus of Arc Hydro was to support surface water modeling, but work has progressed into the groundwater realm. ESRI plans to link the two systems into one complete data modeling framework in the near future.</p><p>The Ministry of Natural Resources - Water Resources Information Program (WRIP) was involved in a multi-year project to develop standardized Arc Hydro surface water data sessions based on the Quaternary Watershed fabric for the Province of Ontario. Each session contains foundation layers required for fundamental hydrologic watershed analysis.</p><p>To meet the requirements of Arc Hydro, the project team followed rigorous quality checking and assurance procedures which resulted in extensive and significant base data improvements across the Province. These enhancements are regarded collectively as a 'snapshot' version of our hydrology base and derivative products. Base data updates are happening on a continual basis, which will have implications on any derivative or related product that has been produced to date by the Province. Any further work in Arc Hydro will depend on available resources and support from the various business areas interested in utilizing these data and tools.</p><p>Some key elements of the project include:</p><li>Basic terrain preprocessing developed for each Arc Hydro session populating the Drainage and Network components of the model</li><li>Setting up a Regional ID framework to manage Arc Hydro's HydroID at the Provincial level</li><li>The concepts of Global Delineation and Thresholding explored for complex quaternary sessions and nested watershed scenarios</li><li>Leveraging the WRIP water flow network in Arc Hydro analysis</li>",2007 - 2009,"<p><a href=""http://geo.scholarsportal.info/#r/details/_uri@=1265545730"">Access this resource</a> on Scholars Geoportal.</p>",http://images.scholarsportal.info/gis/thumbnails/OGDE/OGDE_AH.png,Various geospatial formats available.,McMaster Students / Staff / Faculty only.

The attributes identify which wetlands have been evaluated and of those which ones have been designated as Provincially Significant.</p> <p>Previous to 2011 this data class contained only Evaluated Wetland data. In the spring of 2011 through the Wetland Consolidation project business areas were consulted to identify the best available existing MNR wetland data for each MNR district. The resulting data were added to this data class where it did not overlap existing Evaluated Wetland data. Sources for wetland data included Wetland Interim (OBM/NTS), Forest Resource Inventory (FRI), Southern Ontario Land Recourse Inventory System (SOLRIS) and MNR district data.</p> <p>Wetlands are lands that are seasonally or permanently flooded by shallow water as well as lands where the water table is close to the surface. In either case, the presence of abundant water causes the formation of moist soils and favours the dominance of water tolerant plants.</p> <p>A Wetland Unit is an individual spatial polygon representing a discrete wetland type. The current wetland types are marsh, fen, swamp, bog, open water or unknown.</p> <p>Evaluated Wetlands are those identified and assessed using the technical criteria in the Ontario Wetland Evaluation System (OWES) manuals. An evaluation may be for either an Evaluated Wetland or an Evaluated Wetland Complex. Not all wetlands in Ontario have been evaluated. An Evaluated Wetland consists of one or more adjacent (contiguous) Wetland Units. An Evaluated Wetland Complex is a group of separated Wetland Units that have similar or complementary biological, social and/or hydrological functions, are located in close proximity, and are functionally linked (ecologically or hydrologically). An Evaluated Wetland Complex may contain adjacent Wetland Units but must comprise at least one separated Wetland Unit. Wetlands that meet certain criteria through OWES are designated as Provincially Significant.</p> <p>The Wetland Unit data are managed independently from other hydro data classes and may overlap waterbodies or other hydro data.</p> <p>In the MNR Alymer District, due to the changing landscape in the south western portion of the province and the vintage of available source data the district chose not to add some of the unevaluated wetland data from the other sources to the existing Wetland Unit Layer. In the Far North Hudson Bay Lowlands and surrounding area some of the wetlands were not available and will be populated through a project with NRCan over the course of the year.</p> <p>Legislated or Legal Authority for Collection: The OWES evaluation information is collected to support the wetlands component of the Provincial Policy Statement.</p> <p>OWES data collection began in the early 1980's and will be on-going.

1814496924,Quaternary Geology of Ontario,Ontario Ministry of Northern Development and Mines,Geology,Ontario,vector,"<p>Great Ice sheets have covered parts of Ontario several times, most recently during the Quaternary Period. This most recent glaciation has played a major role in shaping and creating the physical landscape of Ontario. The deposits and effects of these glaciations are widespread with till being the most common deposit left by the Laurentide Ice Sheet. Three main end members of till were produced, sandy tills from the erosion of Precambrian rocks; silty tills derived from the erosion of carbonate rocks and clayey tills deposited in front of the glacier in local or regional area of ponding. Considerable volumes of melt water were generated by, and discharged from, the glaciers that once occupied Ontario. Large amounts of glacial debris were transported by the meltwater and deposited as stratified sediments under the glacier and along the ice margin (glaciofluvial ice-contact deposits), and beyond the ice margin in rivers and streams (glaciofluvial outwash deposits), lakes (glaciolacustrine and lucustrine deposits) and seas (glaciomarine and marine deposits).</p> <p>The Quaternary Geology Data Set is a digital interpretation of this Surficial Geology for the Province of Ontario, illustrating the general distribution of the various types of Quaternary sediments and the major landforms associated with them.

For further information on the rationale for the revisions, refer to Ecoregions of Ontario Modifications to Angus Hills Site Regions and Districts, Revisions and Rationale, Crins and Uhlig 2000 . In 2002, the spatial data was updated using NRVIS drainage polygon data including islands from Great Lakes, St. Lawrence, and Ottawa River, and more detailed shoreline data. NTS mapping was also used to delineate the northern, eastern (Quebec border), and western (Manitoba border) boundaries of the province. In 2006, the shorelins of the Great Lakes, St. Lawrence, and Ottawa River were removed and the effected polygon boundaries were extended out over the water bodies to the extent of the provincial boundary.

3721947560,Natural Heritage Areas Inventory of Niagara and Haldimand County,Niagara Peninsula Conservation Authority,Physical Environment,Ontario,vector,"<p>The Natural Heritage Areas Inventory of Niagara and Haldimand County is a project that was conducted between April 2006 and December 2009 for the purpose of identifying, classifying and mapping natural heritage areas in the Niagara region watershed (NPCA’s jurisdiction). The goal of the project was to use industry standard, scientifically-defensible protocols to inventory all of the natural areas in the community. The resulting data and map provides a representation of the natural cover and features of the Niagara watershed using the Ecological Land Classification (ELC), a standard in Ontario to classify natural areas.</p><p>Those who have spent time in the natural areas in and around Niagara know that this part of the province, with its Carolinian heritage and proximity to the Great Lakes, is a treasure trove of natural wonders. These areas support a rich diversity of natural features including rare plants and animals, significant habitats and geological formations, and important wildlife corridors. A comprehensive biological inventory to document the vegetative communities of our watershed and their inhabitants has never been completed. As data was collected, the project built on existing information ultimately confirming the significance of known sites and filling information gaps. The result is a solid resource of information, which includes accurate natural heritage mapping, a list of local rarity, and site specific species information that will be of tremendous benefit to all watershed residents.The data collected through the project has helped to foster the development of greater environmental awareness within the community, prioritize restoration opportunities and, will serve as baseline for planning decisions and policy development.</p>",2006 - 2009,"<p><a href=""http://geo.scholarsportal.info/#r/details/_uri@=3721947560"">Access this resource</a> on Scholars Geoportal.</p>",http://images.scholarsportal.info/gis/thumbnails/OCUL/OCUL_NPCA_200609_NAI.png,Various geospatial formats available.,McMaster Students / Staff / Faculty only.

The inclusion has the following effects: Brings the limit of the Flow Direction grid closer to the shoreline resulting in a cleaner product; Allows for the delineation of distinct shoreline catchments not possible in the previous EFD product; Minimizes effects of shoreline bleeding (erroneous catchments being formed in -no-data- areas usually upstream of project areas); and Assigns proper flow directions to minor bays and inlets.</p><p>To cover Ontario the grid has been divided into 16 pieces, existing in their respective UTM zones 15, 16, 17, and 18. Each grid covers major watersheds within these zones. The naming conventions of the grid follow the naming conventions of the Secondary and Tertiary Provincial watershed layers. The resolution of the Enhanced Flow Direction Grid is the same as the Provincial Digital Elevation Model - 10m for southern Ontario (where 1:10,000 base data exists) and 20m for Northern Ontario (where 1:20,000 base data exists).

In 2002, the spatial data was updated using NRVIS drainage polygon data including islands from Great Lakes, St. Lawrence, and Ottawa River, and more detailed shoreline data. NTS mapping was also used to delineate the northern, eastern (Quebec border), and western (Manitoba border) boundaries of the province. In 2006, the shorelins of the Great Lakes, St. Lawrence, and Ottawa River were removed and the effected polygon boundaries were extended out over the water bodies to the extent of the provincial boundary. This modification was undertaken to provide a more generic data layer which is intended to be used as a selection tool, and as a backdrop upon which evolving and multi scalar hydorology layers may be overlain or intersected.</p>",2007 - 2012,"<p><a href=""http://geo.scholarsportal.info/#r/details/_uri@=873023282"">Access this resource</a> on Scholars Geoportal.</p>",http://images.scholarsportal.info/gis/thumbnails/OGDE/OGDE_ECOREGN.png,Various geospatial formats available.,McMaster Students / Staff / Faculty only.

This layer contains species occurrences for over 1700 provincially tracked species, including species with provincial status commonly known as Species at Risk.</p><p>The Element Occurrence (EO) records that form the core of this dataset include: information on the location, status, characteristics, numbers, condition, and distribution of elements of biological diversity using established Natural Heritage Methodology developed by NatureServe and The Nature Conservancy (TNC). An Element Occurrence (EO) is an area of land and/or water in which a species or natural community is, or was, present. An EO should have practical conservation value for the Element as evidenced by potential continued (or historical) presence and/or regular recurrence at a given location.</p><p>For species Elements, the EO often corresponds with the local population, but when appropriate may be a portion of a population or a group of nearby populations (e.g., metapopulation). For community Elements, the EO may represent a stand or patch of a natural community, or a cluster of stands or patches of a natural community. Because they are defined on the basis of biological information, EOs may cross jurisdictional boundaries. An Element Occurrence record is a data management tool that has both spatial and tabular components including a mappable feature and its supporting database. EOs are typically represented by bounded, mapped areas of land and/or water or, at small scales, the centroid point of this area. EO records are most commonly created for current or historically known occurrences of natural communities or native species of conservation interest. They may also be created, in some cases, for extirpated occurrences.
