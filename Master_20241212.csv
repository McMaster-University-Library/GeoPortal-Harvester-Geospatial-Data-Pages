The mission homepage is at the NASA website, but the data are publicly distributed by the USGS EROS Data Center.</p>
 <p>Digital elevation data consists of an ordered array of ground elevations sampled at regular intervals over each grid area. Aside from estimating point elevations, digital elevation has a variety of applications, including terrain modeling, line of sight analysis, water flow and flooding analysis, and many others.</p>
 <p>1 arc second: The most recent version of the SRTM data has a resolution of 1 arc second, which is about 30m x 30m. The coverage is considered near-global, which means approximately 80% of the Earth's landmass is captured.</p>
 <p>3 arc second: For this dataset, 3 arc second refers to the pixel size, which is roughly 90m x 90m.

 <p><em>""The Tectonic Geology Data Set is a digital interpretation of the Tectonic Geology of the Province of Ontario, It illustrates this by 1) grouping volcanic and sedimentary rock units into tectonic assemblages in Precambrain terrains and depositional sequences in the overlying Paleozoic and Mesozoic sedimentary basins; and 2) interpreting the ranges of emplacement ages of all major intrusions and grouping some plutons into suites. Among a range of tectonically significant features, the map also displays major folds, faults, stratigraphic younging directions, interpreted centres of volcanism and locations of U/Pb age determinations, which are numbered and cross-referenced to a table of ages. This map represents the first attempt internationally to subdivide Archean rock units into Tectonic assemblages, and the first attempt in Ontario to subdivide Paleozic and Mesozoic rock units into depositional sequences. </em></p>
 <p><em>The purpose of this map is to portray the distribution of magmatism and sedimentation in time and space in the rock record of Ontario. The intended user is a geologist with an academic or applied mineral exploration interest in the components of the bedrock of Ontario that forms the basis of its geochronometric and tectonic record.""</em></p>

Aside from estimating point elevations, digital elevation has a variety of applications, including terrain modeling, line of sight analysis, water flow and flooding analysis, and many others.</p>
 <p>In this dataset, spacing between elevation values varies with latitude. The values for East/West range from 0.75 to 3 arc seconds, or 8 to 17 metres. Spacing is always 0.75 arc seconds or about 23 metres for North/South.</p>
 <p>The data are provided in separate tiles according to the Canadian National Topographic System (1:50,000) map boundaries. For example, the local area appears as four map sheets: 30M/4, 30M/5, 40P/1 and 40P/8, and each sheet is further divided into an Eastern and a Western tile. Each tile contains 1201 elevation points x 1201 elevation points, for a total of 1,442,401 elevation points. A lower resolution dataset (1:250,000) is also available, but both datasets provide complete coverage of Canada.</p>

 <p>For detailed datasets, layers may be divided according to the <a href=""http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/gi/nationalgrid/nghelp1.html"">Great Britain National Grid</a>.</p>
 <p>Some useful datasets include:</p>
 <p><strong>Meridian 2:</strong> A mid-scale representation of Great Britain, primarily consisting of administrative boundaries and transportation infrastructure. Road networks are simplified to reduce processing time. Polygon data include county and district boundaries, woodland regions and lake regions. Linear data include roadways (separate layers for Motorways, A roads, B roads, and Minor roads), Railroads, Rivers, Coastline and Administrative Area. Point data are mostly related to transportation, including road nodes, roundabouts, and station locations. Also included in the dataset is ""Gridded Height"", which displays topography at using regularly distributed points.</p>
 <p><strong>Boundary Line: </strong>A 1:10 000 scale boundaries dataset, containing all levels of electoral and administrative boundaries. Layers include: Counties, European Constituencies, Metropolitan Districts, Unitary Authorities, and Electoral Regions. Attribute data are limited to district name and area.</p>
 <p><strong>1:250 000 Colour Raster:</strong> A raster ""roadmap"" showing all motorways, A and B roads, all cities and towns, and many villages. Useful as a transportation base map. Data are provided in tiles according to the National Grid. Note that the world files [*.tfw] are provided in a separate directory, and must be placed in the same directory as the *.tif files before importing the data into ArcMap.</p>
 <p><strong>Strategi:</strong> An excellent overview of Great Britain providing 21 vector layers relating to Roads, Railways, Airports, Trails, Water Features, Settlements, Political and Administrative Boundaries, Land Use (Wood/Forest, Marsh, Islands etc.), and a variety of ""Other"" features, mostly relating to Historical Sites/Antiquities, Communications, and Tourism. There are also text layers intended to overlay corresponding geospatial layers.</p>
 <p><strong>OS Street View:</strong> A very detailed street-level raster, useful as a high resolution backdrop. Because of its high resolution, the data are distributed in small tiles (i.e. the data for one National Grid square is made up of almost 400 separate tiles). Note that the world files [*.tfw] are provided in a separate directory, and must be placed in the same directory as the *.tif files before importing the data into ArcMap.</p>
 <p><strong>Land-form PANORAMA Contours:</strong> A vector representation of topographic contours, provided in AutoCAD DXF format. Data are provided in small tiles (i.e. one National Grid square is made up of 25 group layer tiles). Height data are stored within the attributes of each feature.</p>",<p>Additional information and specifications are available for some datasets online.

It provides geospatial vector data describing hydrographic features such as lakes, reservoirs, rivers, streams, canals, islands, obstacles (e.g. waterfalls, rapids, rocks in water) and constructions (e.g. dams, wharves, dikes), as well as a linear drainage network and the toponymic information (geographical names) associated to hydrography.</p>
 <p>The modeling work of the NHN is based in part on Linear referencing System (LRS) concepts. This approach allows the management of geometric representations separately from attribute information (referred to as events in LRS). Unique identifiers (called National Identifiers - NID), associated to each NHN feature, allow for efficient management of updates. The NHN is a vector, topographic data product primarily designed to allow hydrographic network analysis. It is intented for water flow analysis, water and watershed management, environmental and hydrographical applications, as well as for a multitude of cartographic applications.</p>","<p>For a complete description of NHN product metadata, refer to the record in the <a href=""http://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/a4b190fe-e090-4e6d-881e-b87956c07977"">Open Government Portal</a>.</p>","<p>National Hydro Network [computer file].

The area actually irrigated was smaller, but is unknown for most countries. A special note has to be made for Australia and India where the map shows the total area actually irrigated. This is due to the fact that statistics collected in Australia and India refer to actually irrigated area as opposed to statistics with area equipped for irrigation which are collected in most other countries. An explanation of the different terminology to indicate areas under irrigation is given in a <a href=""http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/irrigationmap/index20.stm"">glossary</a>.</p>
 <p>Since 1999 the methodology to produce the map has been improved which made it possible to increase the spatial resolution of the map to 5 arc minutes (about 10 km at the equator). The objective of the cooperation between the Universities and FAO is to develop global GIS coverage of areas equipped for irrigation and to make it available to users in the international community. The data collected through the AQUASTAT surveys will be used to improve the overall quality and resolution of the information.</p>

<p>""The National Broadband Data represents coverage information across Canada for existing broadband service providers with their associated technology types. The coverage information is aggregated and deployed over a grid of hexagons, which cover areas of roughly 25 square km each. Broadband Internet service availability is provided for download/upload speed markers (5/1, 10/2, 25/5 and 50/10 Mbps) where more than 75% of total dwellings covered within the hexagon have access to broadband service offerings meeting these markers.</p>
<p>In order to improve the granularity of the broadband data, ISED and the CRTC are providing aggregated and anonymous broadband services data based on the pseudo-household statistical model, hence achieving higher precision in depicting the broadband Internet service availability. This information is available under the ""NBD PHH Speeds"" resource. For more information on the pseudo-household statistical model, refer to the <a href=""https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/b3a1d603-19ca-466c-ae95-b5185e56addf"">Pseudo-Household Demographic Distribution dataset</a>.</p>

<p>The High Resolution Digital Elevation Model (HRDEM) product is derived from airborne LiDAR data (mainly in the south) and satellite images in the north. The complete coverage of the Canadian territory is gradually being established. It includes a Digital Terrain Model (DTM), a Digital Surface Model (DSM) and other derived data. For DTM datasets, derived data available are slope, aspect, shaded relief, color relief and color shaded relief maps and for DSM datasets, derived data available are shaded relief, color relief and color shaded relief maps.</p>
<p>The productive forest line is used to separate the northern and the southern parts of the country. This line is approximate and may change based on requirements. In the southern part of the country (south of the productive forest line), DTM and DSM datasets are generated from airborne LiDAR data. They are offered at a 1 m or 2 m resolution and projected to the UTM NAD83 (CSRS) coordinate system and the corresponding zones. The datasets at a 1 m resolution cover an area of 10 km x 10 km while datasets at a 2 m resolution cover an area of 20 km by 20 km. In the northern part of the country (north of the productive forest line), due to the low density of vegetation and infrastructure, only DSM datasets are generally generated. Most of these datasets have optical digital images as their source data. They are generated at a 2 m resolution using the Polar Stereographic North coordinate system referenced to WGS84 horizontal datum or UTM NAD83 (CSRS) coordinate system. Each dataset covers an area of 50 km by 50 km. For some locations in the north, DSM and DTM datasets can also be generated from airborne LiDAR data. In this case, these products will be generated with the same specifications as those generated from airborne LiDAR in the southern part of the country. </p>",<p>Metadata and product specifications available with downloads.</p>,,N/A,Internet,Topography,Canada,Raster,,,,,,,,,

<p>Point cloud files are distributed by LiDAR acquisition project without integration between projects.</p>
<p>The point cloud files are distributed using the compressed .LAZ / Cloud Optimized Point Cloud (COPC) format. The COPC open format is an octree reorganization of the data inside a .LAZ 1.4 file. It allows efficient use and visualization rendering via HTTP calls (e.g. via the web), while offering the capabilities specific to the compressed .LAZ format which is already well established in the industry. Point cloud files are therefore both downloadable for local use and viewable via URL links from a cloud computing environment.</p>
<p>The reference system used for all point clouds in the product is NAD83(CSRS), epoch 2010. The projection used is the UTM projection with the corresponding zone.

<p>Bathymetry is the measurement of water depth in lakes. From the 1940s to the 1990s, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry produced bathymetry maps for over 11,000 lakes across Ontario.</p>
 
<p>The data can be used by the general public and GIS specialists for:</p>
<ul>
<li>climate chnage modelling</li>
<li>fish monitoring and other ecological applications</li>
<li>hydrologic cycle modelling</li>
<li>recreational fishing maps</li>
<li>watershed-based water budgeting</li>
</ul>
 
<p>The maps were created using simple methods to determine lake depths. They were meant for resource anagement purposes only. Little effort was made to identify shoal and other hazads when creating these bathymetric maps.</p>
 
<p>Since this data was collected, many constructed and naturally occuring events could mean that the depth information is now inaccurate, so these maps should not be used for navigational purposes. In many cases, these maps still represent the only authoritative source of bathymetry data for lakes in Ontario.</p>",<p>A detailed outline of the Ontario Historic Bathymetry Maps metadata can be found at the following link: https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/19b6e1fbfba846cd80a11acda6b9e1d4/info/metadata/metadata.xml?format=default&output=html</p>,"Format: Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry.

This series was produced between 1956 and 1977, and includes over 600 individual topographic map sheets for the Province of Ontario. Maps cover mostly populated and border regions, and show both natural and man-made features such as relief, spot heights, administrative boundaries, roads, railways, trails, waterways, bridges, buildings, mills, power lines, terrain, and land formations.</p> <p>Once this index is added to the map, clicking on the index tiles will indicate the topographic map coverage. This allows early topographic maps to be found based on regions of interest. When a tile is selected, this search box will populate with all relevant maps that include coverage of the selected area, in chronological order. Maps can then be viewed on the map sheet, downloaded, or explained in greater detail.</p> <p><b>Content advisory:</b> The topographic maps on this site are historical documents that reflect the time and environment in which they were created. Some maps may contain place names and other terms that may be racist, offensive, or derogatory. Many of these place names have been officially rescinded in the years since the creation of the maps, and the Geographic Names Board of Canada, along with provincial naming authorities, continue the ongoing work of removing offensive place names from the Canadian Geographical Names Database (CGNDB). For historical and research purposes, we offer access to these maps in their complete original and unchanged form with the intention of representing Canada’s history of racial and colonial discrimination, and the ensuing legacy of this harm.

This most recent glaciation has played a major role in shaping and creating the physical landscape of Ontario. The deposits and effects of these glaciations are widespread with till being the most common deposit left by the Laurentide Ice Sheet. Three main end members of till were produced, sandy tills from the erosion of Precambrian rocks; silty tills derived from the erosion of carbonate rocks and clayey tills deposited in front of the glacier in local or regional area of ponding. Considerable volumes of melt water were generated by, and discharged from, the glaciers that once occupied Ontario. Large amounts of glacial debris were transported by the meltwater and deposited as stratified sediments under the glacier and along the ice margin (glaciofluvial ice-contact deposits), and beyond the ice margin in rivers and streams (glaciofluvial outwash deposits), lakes (glaciolacustrine and lucustrine deposits) and seas (glaciomarine and marine deposits).</p> <p>The Quaternary Geology Data Set is a digital interpretation of this Surficial Geology for the Province of Ontario, illustrating the general distribution of the various types of Quaternary sediments and the major landforms associated with them. Glacial tills, fluvial, lacustrine and organic deposits are illustrated as 30 distinct structured geological units illustrating the Quaternary stratigraphy of Ontario.

Some maps may contain place names and other terms that may be racist, offensive, or derogatory. Many of these place names have been officially rescinded in the years since the creation of the maps, and the Geographic Names Board of Canada, along with provincial naming authorities, continue the ongoing work of removing offensive place names from the Canadian Geographical Names Database (CGNDB).

Maps cover mostly populated and border regions, and show both natural and man-made features such as relief, spot heights, administrative boundaries, secondary and side roads, railways, trails, wooded areas, waterways including lakes, rivers, streams and rapids, bridges, buildings, mills, power lines, terrain, and land formations.</p> <p>Once this index is added to the map, clicking on the index tiles will indicate the topographic map coverage. This allows early topographic maps to be found based on regions of interest.

Maps can then be viewed on the map sheet, downloaded, or explained in greater detail.</p> <p><b>Content advisory:</b> The topographic maps on this site are historical documents that reflect the time and environment in which they were created. Some maps may contain place names and other terms that may be racist, offensive, or derogatory. Many of these place names have been officially rescinded in the years since the creation of the maps, and the Geographic Names Board of Canada, along with provincial naming authorities, continue the ongoing work of removing offensive place names from the Canadian Geographical Names Database (CGNDB).
