","<p>The map shows the amount of area equipped for irrigation around the turn of the 20th century as a percentage of the total area on a raster with a resolution of 5 arc minutes. The area actually irrigated was smaller, but is unknown for most countries. A special note has to be made for Australia and India where the map shows the total area actually irrigated. This is due to the fact that statistics collected in Australia and India refer to actually irrigated area as opposed to statistics with area equipped for irrigation which are collected in most other countries. An explanation of the different terminology to indicate areas under irrigation is given in a <a href=""http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/irrigationmap/index20.stm"">glossary</a>.</p>
<p>Since 1999 the methodology to produce the map has been improved which made it possible to increase the spatial resolution of the map to 5 arc minutes (about 10 km at the equator). The objective of the cooperation between the Universities and FAO is to develop global GIS coverage of areas equipped for irrigation and to make it available to users in the international community. The data collected through the AQUASTAT surveys will be used to improve the overall quality and resolution of the information.</p>

","<p>Maps showing land capability to support forest species. Equivalent to the Canada Land Inventory 1:250,000 paper maps series.</p>
<p>The mapping of land capability for forestry is based on a national classification system comparable with the other Canada Land Inventory sectors. Land is rated according to seven classes on its capability to grow commercial timber in areas stocked with the optimum number and species of trees. This rating considers the land in its natural state, without improvements such as fertilization, drainage, or amelioration practices.</p>
<p>Land ratings and classes may change, however, significant changes will only be achieved through costly and continuing practices. The best lands for tree growth are Class 1 while Class 7 land can not yield timber in commercial quantities, these represent the extremes.</p>
<p>The capability mappings have a scale of 1:250,000 and are accomplished through interpretation of air photographs and field surveys.</p>

","<p>The National Map represents the joint contributions of many federal agencies to provide maps and geospatial data for a variety of themes.  The website provides access to topographic maps, historical maps, elevation data, hydrography data, and geospatial data.</p>
<p>Since the retirement of the 1997-2014 Edition of the National Atlas of the United States, The National Map now offers a collection of 197 small-scale datasets that can be downloaded for free. Additionally, the Set of Dynamic Topographic Maps Illustrating Physical Features and hundreds of printable maps are offered by The National Map.</p>
<p>The National Map Small-Scale Collection website also links to Global Map, an international effort by national mapping organizations to produce consistent and accurate mapping data of the world at a scale of 1:1,000,000.</p>
<p>The National Map publishes two data collections at one million-scale: one for Global Map users and one for National Map users. In terms of vector geometry, the lines, points, and areas in these data collections are identical. The difference is in the attributes assigned to these features.</p>","<p>A complete metadata file is available to view on The National Map website.</p>

","<p>The National Hydro Network (NHN), focuses on providing a quality geometric description and a set of basic attributes describing Canada's inland surface waters. It provides geospatial vector data describing hydrographic features such as lakes, reservoirs, rivers, streams, canals, islands, obstacles (e.g. waterfalls, rapids, rocks in water) and constructions (e.g. dams, wharves, dikes), as well as a linear drainage network and the toponymic information (geographical names) associated to hydrography.</p>
<p>The modeling work of the NHN is based in part on Linear referencing System (LRS) concepts. This approach allows the management of geometric representations separately from attribute information (referred to as events in LRS). Unique identifiers (called National Identifiers - NID), associated to each NHN feature, allow for efficient management of updates. The NHN is a vector, topographic data product primarily designed to allow hydrographic network analysis. It is intented for water flow analysis, water and watershed management, environmental and hydrographical applications, as well as for a multitude of cartographic applications.</p>

","<p>The Selected World Mineral Deposits Database is part of a project co-sponsored by the Geological Survey of Canada and ten exploration and mining companies. Additional data was supplied by collaborators in various countries. The database contains records for 1,578 mineral deposits of a variety of commodities in 150 countries of the world. Commodities include precious metals, base metals, ferrous metals, rare earth elements, bauxite, uranium, diamonds, emeralds and industrial minerals. The database also includes information about the geological deposits in which the minerals are found, and an extensive bibliography. File format: The original file is in Microsoft Access database format (.mdb). The library has also converted this format to shapefile and dbf for use in GIS.  A guide to <a href=""https://library.mcmaster.ca/sites/default/files/geospat-mineral-abbrev-1801_abr.pdf"">mineral abbreviations</a> to assist researchers with interpretation of the commodity codes has been created by the library.</p>

","<p>The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) was a collaborative effort between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), and the German and Italian space agencies, to generate a near-global digital elevation model (DEM).  The mission homepage is at the NASA website, but the data are publically distributed by the USGS EROS Data Center.</p>
<p>Digital elevation data consists of an ordered array of ground elevations sampled at regular intervals over each grid area.   Aside from estimating point elevations, digital elevation has a variety of applications, including terrain modeling, line of sight analysis, water flow and flooding analysis, and many others.</p>
<p>1 arc second: The most recent version of the SRTM data  has a resolution of 1 arc second, which is about 30m x 30m. The coverage is considered near-global, which means approximately 80% of the Earth's landmass is captured.</p>
<p>3 arc second: For this dataset, 3 arc second refers to the pixel size, which is roughly 90m x 90m.  Each tile has a size of 1201 x 1201 pixels, covering roughly 36km x 36km (e.g. the local tile covers the core area of the Golden Horseshoe).  The files are provided in .bil format, which can be immediately displayed in ArcMap.</p>
<p>30 arc second: A 30 arc second grid roughly translates to a pixel size of 1km x 1km.  These tiles are much larger than the 3 arc second tiles both in coverage and in pixel number.  For example, the ""local"" tile is 4800 x 6000 pixels in size, covering all of Ontario and Quebec, some of Manitoba and Nunavut, and with North-South coverage from the northeastern United States up to Greenland.  The files are provided in .dem format, which can be immediately displayed in ArcMap.</p>

Among a range of tectonically significant features, the map also displays major folds, faults, stratigraphic younging directions, interpreted centres of volcanism and locations of U/Pb age determinations, which are numbered and cross-referenced to a table of ages.   This map represents the first attempt internationally to subdivide Archean rock units into Tectonic assemblages, and the first attempt in Ontario to subdivide Paleozic and Mesozoic rock units into depositional sequences.  </em></p>
